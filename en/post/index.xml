        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/cooperative-education/ready-or-not-logo-squad-black-and-white.png" alt="Featured image of post Cooperative Education" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fan of hardcore simulation games, I have dabbled in simulation games in various fields, including FPS games. However, as we can see, hardcore simulation FPS is very different from mainstream FPS, so I tend to divide all FPS into three types: hardcore, semi-simulation and entertainment. The first type of hardcore includes Arma, Squad, Ready or Not, Escape from Tarkov, Ground Branch and other works, and the second type of semi-simulation is Insurgency: Sandstorm, Battlefield, DayZ and so on. Entertainment is relatively broad, including Call of Duty, Apex Legends, Counter-Strike, Fortnite and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the level of simulation, we can know the degree of &amp;ldquo;hardcore&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Dimension&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Judgment criteria&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damage model/TTK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;One or two shots kill, no blood recovery; wound type segmentation&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballistic physics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;There are drop, wind deflection, penetration, initial velocity, bullet type differences, etc.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operation complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Switch safety, pull bolt, manually load magazine, check ammunition&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modification freedom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Generally high, including gun modification details and customized full body equipment&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interface/information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;No HUD, no crosshairs, no radar&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical dependence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Strong reliance on teamwork, voice communication, tactical coordination&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Military communication, medical, supply, logistics system&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Huge map (strategic) or small map (tactical), always realistic&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death penalty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Zero cost or high cost&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively speaking, the more hardcore the game, the fewer players there are, and the higher the level required of the developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death penalty, is a big difference between hardcore FPS games. Some of them (e.x. Tarkov) set up a extremely serious penalty, but some have almost no penalty (e.x. RoN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there is a interesting topic: Despite hardcore FPS is difficult, why do people still like to play it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are reasons for this. From a general perspective, it includes the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;immersion&#34;&gt;Immersion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it is a visual work or a novel, immersion has always been an important evaluation dimension. Novels and visual works often use gorgeous pictures and texts to attract the audience, while hardcore FPS games go the opposite way, bringing an immersive feeling by simulating the real environment as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of realistic gameplay is also about the real environment. This will make the modeling and rendering effects of hardcore FPS much higher than those of mainstream FPS. The more realistic reflections and volumetric clouds/fog can sometimes be comparable to 3A works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;teamwork--communication&#34;&gt;Teamwork &amp;amp; Communication
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike twitchy shooters where you can solo carry, hardcore FPS always demands cooperation. You can be John Wick, but it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible. In Ready Or Not, solo CQB is extremely dangerous and no one would try or recommend it in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;skill-learning&#34;&gt;Skill Learning
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardcore FPS rewards system for correct knowledge application, patience and discipline, not just quick reaction, not gun. Learning bullet trajectory, equipment management, tactical movements and communication cooperation management does not provide any rewards in itself, but by using these to successfully complete the mission, you will know what is useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;take-ready-or-not-as-an-example&#34;&gt;Take Ready or Not as an example
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardcore FPS games often have RPG elements, and RoN is particularly good at this.
In RoN, a few bullets = death. One clean shot can end you, without health regen. You can get crippled, bleed out, or go down instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes every action must meet the standard, and rushing out of the cover directly is asking for trouble. The game does not reward recklessness, nor does it deduct points for taking extra time. Caution is often the best, even if it takes more time. It is stressful, but it feels real. Surviving a mission with zero casualties feels rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In RoN, bullet penetration is real. Cover is not always safe. Your 9mm bullet will not penetrate wood like a 5.56. Walls can be full of holes and you may not know which hole a suspect is shooting from. If you don&amp;rsquo;t crouch down and hold your shield, your shield will shake and you will take damage. There is no sliding, jumping or even running here. In real life, no one wants the sound of running footsteps to alert the suspect to the arrival of SWAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In RoN, there is no gear loss like in Tarkov, you get an F for failing a mission, and losing a teammate means a lower score. Unexpected deaths are stressful. It is the ultimate realization of &amp;ldquo;tactical fantasy&amp;rdquo;. Perfect coordination, precise point shooting, correct use of tactical weapons, clearing suspects without injury and completing the mission itself carries a sense of professionalism and coolness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

          &lt;th&gt;Mainstream FPS&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Ready or Not&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Kill to win / Win the game&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Complete the mission / Rescue the hostages / Clear the target&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death penalty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Drop rank&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Mission failure&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Player behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Reaction, luck, shooting&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Tactics, judgment, coordination&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atmosphere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Exciting but chaotic&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Calm, depressing, realistic&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI enemies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Stupid&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Relatively smart + deceptive &lt;br&gt;(fake surrender, attack from behind)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gameplay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Fast pace&lt;br&gt;restart after the game&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Slow pace&lt;br&gt;focus on process and details&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the charm of RoN lies in that it forces you to restrain, learn, bear the consequences, learn the practices of real SWAT teams, understand the importance of cover, and truly learn CQB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is not just a simulation of SWAT, but it trains players to become SWAT and understand the thinking of SWAT when performing tasks. Players start to find cover as much as possible, instead of &amp;ldquo;gunning&amp;rdquo; or blindly entering open areas, start to prioritize controlling the perspective, instead of blindly pushing the map, and learn how to let teammates cover themselves, instead of being a lone wolf hero. Skilled and realistic operations are accumulated through repeated officer downs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, the community environment of this type of tactical shooting/hardcore FPS games is more equal and friendly, there is generally no ranking system, everyone respects each other more, even if the skills are not good, they will only say that you are unprofessional. It is not like the mainstream FPS where the high rankings look down on the low ones and scold teammates for mistakes. In theory, the death penalty of the former is higher. Why can&amp;rsquo;t mainstream FPS players accept failure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, we can find that in hardcore FPS, death is often quick and fatal, but the game rhythm is slow, and cooperation is more important than individual performance. A mistake often leads to the failure of the entire team. Failure is serious, but also very natural. Players understand that anyone can be killed, not who is too bad. &amp;ldquo;Teamwork is more important than individual skills&amp;rdquo; is reflected here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mainstream FPS, the fast-paced environment, leaderboards and quantitative indicators such as KDA are very prominent. Failure is seen as a lack of personal ability, and teammates are prone to accusing or dragging the team down. This is because in a battle, a highly skilled person can defeat others 1v10 through various &amp;ldquo;skills&amp;rdquo; and techniques. In this type of game, there are no Rules of Engagement, but Rules of Elimination. Recklessness is rewarded, and caution is punished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the two communities is also huge. Hardcore FPS game communities are usually dominated by players who like military simulations and teamwork. They emphasize &amp;ldquo;respecting tactical processes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;learning and communication&amp;rdquo;. Poor skills can also be seen as a need for practice, and the community is more inclined to guidance/discussion rather than malicious attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mainstream FPS community has a larger player base with varying levels of skill. Rankings and popularity make the competition more stressful, and players are more likely to be anxious or emotional. The language environment is more likely to become a battlefield because the game rhythm is intense and the emotions fluctuate greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Factors&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Tactical shooting games&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Mainstream FPS&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rhythm and failure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Slow pace, high cost of failure, team responsibility&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Fast pace, high pressure on individual performance&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community atmosphere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Cooperation first&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Intense competition, obvious comparison&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ranking influence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;No or weak ranking, reduced comparison&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Kill quantification, high pressure on ranking&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failure acceptance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Failure is a learning process&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Failure is seen as a lack of ability&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Player screening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Like immersion and rigor&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Diversity, complex mentality&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;idealized-education-system&#34;&gt;Idealized Education System
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by hardcore FPS, we found that increasing difficulty and removing competition will not repel players, but will make players actively learn and research, stimulating the motivation of independent learning. So how can we change the education system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core concept is that students are not trained to &amp;ldquo;win the game&amp;rdquo; (grades), but to train like athletes. Not only pass, but also solve real problems and gain the ability to solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-step-exam-changes&#34;&gt;First step: Exam Changes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple exams are allowed, multiple attempts are allowed, no time limit.&lt;/strong&gt;
In fact, the role of rankings is just to increase pressure, and the so-called positive effect is just to promote the superiority of those who rank high and to discourage those who rank low. This is why they need to be removed in the first place. A more open evaluation method can reduce the focus on grades and focus more on something truly valuable. The penalties for poor test scores should be weakened, and more time should be spent on reviewing and retrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;second-step-more-teamwork&#34;&gt;Second step: More Teamwork
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All core learning tasks need to be completed through real collaboration.&lt;/strong&gt;
The difficulty and cost of completing the task by one person must be set very high. By encouraging real cooperation, rather than forcing tasks to be bound without any interests. The task must be in everyone&amp;rsquo;s interest and related to the interests of the group. Group members need to be randomly assigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;third-step-pacing&#34;&gt;Third step: Pacing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-paced, independent time planning.&lt;/strong&gt;
Unlike a universal learning pace that is synchronized for all students, each individual&amp;rsquo;s pace should be different, the pace should be suitable for them, and they should not know each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fourth-step-minimal-guidance&#34;&gt;Fourth step: Minimal Guidance
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal, limited, appropriate guidance.&lt;/strong&gt;
Minimal guidance and prompting and the removal of time limits allow students to learn to observe, analyze, and act early in their learning. The subsequent pace of learning can naturally accelerate, and students have very strong autonomous learning abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fifth-step-comprehensive-rating-feedback&#34;&gt;Fifth step: Comprehensive Rating Feedback
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debriefing, report, portfolios instead of rankings, class placement, GPA.&lt;/strong&gt;
The core of the evaluation should not be based on standardized test scores, but on actual results, works and discussions. Less passive memorization of instruction and more integration into project learning objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-point-of-idealized-education-system&#34;&gt;Key Point of Idealized Education System
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;mission-based-curriculum--learning-through-immersion&#34;&gt;Mission-Based Curriculum &amp;amp; Learning through Immersion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each subject has a clear target application scenario. The number of application questions should not be increased, but reduced and as few as possible with high quality. Project objectives should be exactly in line with the subject. They should not be designed to be too simple, as that would lose interest. Simple knowledge points should use simpler question formats, while project learning objectives should be more complex and often have no unified answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and test a bridge with given constraints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Role-play policy advisors in historical turning points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;allow-slow-tactical-pacing&#34;&gt;Allow Slow, Tactical Pacing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t pursue speed in the early stages of learning, which is why time limits are removed. Not everyone learns at the same speed, so the time it takes for everyone to reach a certain point will also be different. Practice on the basis of excellent quality, and speed will also be improved on the basis of excellent quality. Quality always takes precedence over speed. The same is true in the market. There is no shortage of products, but there is a shortage of excellent products, and even more so, great products. Over time, good and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage pauses for reflection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows retrying of failed methods with better planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normalize debriefs after major assignments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;team-accountability&#34;&gt;Team Accountability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional classes are still too large organizations. Ideally, each group should not exceed 5 people, and individual achievements need to be balanced with collective achievements. Too large a collective organization will drown out individual achievements, and too small an organization is not conducive to the development of collaborative skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear roles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team success &amp;gt; individual brilliance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in peer review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;natural-punishment-and-reward&#34;&gt;Natural Punishment and Reward
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grades replaced or supported by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning and assigning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task completion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requirement achievement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post-mission reports &amp;amp; Reflections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;respect-based-community&#34;&gt;Respect-Based Community
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In RoN, failure is expected, and support is constructive. Facts have also proved that positive thoughts are always more conducive to learning and progress than negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove rigid ranking systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emphasize shared growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use feedback instead of shame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace “gifted vs. average” with “trained vs. untrained”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up the above, we find that the high difficulty represented by hardcore FPS games is not disgusting. We can improve the learning environment that is also considered to be difficult in the same way, thereby improving our perception and enthusiasm for learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage deep, experiential learning over fast test-taking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultivate teamwork and communication as a central skill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace failure as tactical feedback, not personal inadequacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality always over speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat students as person in training, not score chasers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make learning immersive, strategic, and professionally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Time Travel in MWI</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/time-travel-in-mwi/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/time-travel-in-mwi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/time-travel-in-mwi/TVL.png" alt="Featured image of post Time Travel in MWI" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In classical conceptions of time travel, particularly within a single-timeline universe, the grandfather paradox poses a serious logical problem: if a person travels back in time and prevents their grandfather from having children, how could the time traveler have been born to commit the act in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that the grandfather paradox assumes two premises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We live in a shared reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reality of the past and the future is the same, and all events are caused by cause and effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, these two assumptions are not correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;time-travel-under-mwi&#34;&gt;Time Travel Under MWI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)&lt;/strong&gt; of quantum mechanics offers a fundamentally different framework that avoids such paradoxes altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MWI posits that every quantum event with multiple possible outcomes causes the universe to split into multiple, non-interacting branches, each representing a different outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional MWI theory holds that the universe does not have a single timeline, but an infinite &amp;ldquo;tree&amp;rdquo; composed of divergent world lines. In fact, it is more likely that all the divergent world lines themselves have always existed and formed a &amp;ldquo;grid&amp;rdquo; in which consciousness constantly shuttles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If time travel is possible in such a framework, then the traveler is not moving backwards along a single timeline. We know that the traveler is actually constantly traveling between worldlines, so their arrival in the &amp;ldquo;past&amp;rdquo; will result in the creation or intersection of a new worldline, a parallel branch that diverges from the point of arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this branching structure, meeting a version of your past self is plausible. However, the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; that exists in that past is not the exact same entity that became the future traveler. Rather, it is a copy on a parallel worldline. The moment you travel back, you create or join a branch where both versions of you co-exist, and their timelines may continue independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we also know that shadow people do not have a dominant consciousness, which means you will meet your shadow people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-the-grandfather-paradox-doesnt-occur&#34;&gt;Why the Grandfather Paradox Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Occur
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this branching, any actions taken in the &amp;ldquo;past&amp;rdquo; do not overwrite the traveler&amp;rsquo;s origin timeline. If you were to stop your grandfather from having children in that new branch, it would not affect the original branch from which you came. Instead, it would only change the course of history in that particular parallel world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, causality is preserved within each branch, and no contradictions arise. The original sequence of events that led to your birth remains intact in your original worldline, even if you prevent it in another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, your shadow copy has no logical connection with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our MWI framework, there is only one dominant consciousness, so even if the dominant consciousness returns to the world lines it has been to, it will only encounter its own &amp;ldquo;shadow man&amp;rdquo;. This will not cause the dominant consciousness to suddenly visit itself in its memory, because the dominant consciousness returns to that world line after it has experienced that world line. The dominant consciousness&amp;rsquo;s memory will not change because it does not have the experience of the &amp;ldquo;shadow man&amp;rdquo; on the world line it returned to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in theory, there is nothing wrong with killing your grandfather. Furthermore, if your grandfather has passed away, then you have not actually killed anyone, because at this time all &amp;ldquo;grandfathers&amp;rdquo; are just empty shells, and the dominant consciousness has left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MWI, time travel is as easy as moving around in the three-dimensional world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>HTTrack  vs Cyotek WebCopy</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/httrack-vs-cyotek-webcopy/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/httrack-vs-cyotek-webcopy/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to sort out some blogs that might disappear at any time. I have two options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to downloading entire websites for offline browsing, HTTrack and Cyotek WebCopy are two of the most well-known tools. They have both been out of update for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an absolutely terrible experience with Cyotek WebCopy, which seemed to be newer, but somehow downloaded many times slower than HTTrack. The crawler depth setting was too rigid, and if the website structure was too flat (most blogs), there would be some scanning issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we don&amp;rsquo;t have a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Feature&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTrack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyotek WebCopy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;First Released&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1998&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2013&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Last Update&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2017&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2023&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Open Source&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Yes (GPL licensed)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Platform&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Windows, Linux, macOS (via Wine)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Windows only&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;User Interface&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Outdated, functional&lt;/td&gt;

          &lt;td&gt;Powerful (wildcards, filters)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Available, but harder to configure&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Login Form Support&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Manual cookie handling required&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Basic form-based login supported&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;

      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Command Line Support&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Full command-line interface&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;GUI only&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Export/Import Configurations&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Supports &lt;code&gt;.opt&lt;/code&gt; files&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;No configuration export&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Speed&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Faster (configurable parallelism)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Slower (fewer threads)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither tool supports JavaScript-rendered sites very well. We really need new website downloading tools - not these two decades-old antiques that continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shadow People in MWI</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP04.png" alt="Featured image of post Shadow People in MWI" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;occupancy&#34;&gt;Occupancy
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on what was discussed previously, 99.99999% of world-lines are empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that most of the world lines that consciousness experiences are simply filled with other people, animals, and things that have no consciousness. These people and animals are called &amp;ldquo;shadows&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;shadow people&amp;rdquo; because while they appear to move and think, they have no consciousness. They are projections of consciousness, and their main consciousness is somewhere else. They are the &amp;ldquo;what ifs&amp;rdquo; of the action and the landscape that your consciousness interacts with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visualize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP01.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1481&#34;
	height=&#34;907&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP01_hu_18ffcc8e7dcfd54f.png 480w, https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP01_hu_e22984110c1af7.png 1024w&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;391px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is a simplification. In reality, all the “shadow people” possess a consciousness. This explains why the thoughts of those around you affect your MWI navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some small percentage of a consciousness within every shadow entity. It’s just that the percentage is very tiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the infinite lines of the world has consciousness running through it. Not just other people&amp;rsquo;s, but yours as well. It&amp;rsquo;s an almost insignificant amount. Your consciousness dominates all other consciousnesses in the world line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP02.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1470&#34;
	height=&#34;907&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP02_hu_360e0953916b7d77.png 480w, https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP02_hu_9cab663e63164cf0.png 1024w&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;388px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;some-explanations&#34;&gt;Some explanations
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In quantum physics, when two quanta meet, they become entangled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the realm outside of our reality; the one that contains all the near-infinite numbers of world-lines, there isn’t any time or space. It’s a region with no geometry. So everything can entangle in a quantum sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means there is no world-lines are independent. They are all connected to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is actually happening is that clusters of world-lines entangle with other clusters of world-lines. They do this when ever a consciousness is injected into a world-line template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all of this entanglement puts a little infinitesimal part of you, and those around you near you in what ever world-line that your consciousness happens to occupy at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are other factors at play. Injecting consciousness into a template does not mean that the entire infinite number of world lines are entangled. The effect will &amp;ldquo;fade out,&amp;rdquo; or diminish as the variance increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will resemble something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP03.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1380&#34;
	height=&#34;844&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP03_hu_652491b6f3f9b5d1.png 480w, https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP03_hu_4c0adba31f17793.png 1024w&#34;
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;392px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability of a consciousness to entangle with “close proximity” world-lines happens automatically. However, the ability for the entangled world-lines to entangle with other world-lines drops off as the degree of variance increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider that this is happening for the billions upon billions of people that are entering and leaving our template surface. Each one is “making their marks”. All combine to provide some “foot print” of their present upon the template that you inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;paradox&#34;&gt;Paradox
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that everyone was 100% fully conscious in their bodies, and that the mind controlled our reality, our reality would probably become a very confusing, ever-changing mess of reality. Reality will also change as quickly and irrationally as dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP04.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1381&#34;
	height=&#34;862&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP04_hu_e638f18b6f141321.png 480w, https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP04_hu_ae5ad15e10589696.png 1024w&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person&amp;rsquo;s consciousness is the dominant consciousness in the world line he lives in, it means that his thoughts are also the dominant thoughts in the world line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By controlling and directing thoughts, we can not only control our navigation, but our influence in the strong quantum entanglements of “near-by” (but untraveled) world-lines means that we have the potential to influence the trends and behaviors of the environment around us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>False Positives in MWI Navigation</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/false-positives-in-mwi-navigation/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/false-positives-in-mwi-navigation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that can be pretty common in an intention campaign is the presence of “false positives”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False positives are events or things that appear to match your verbal affirmations in substance, but have some glaring defect that makes them unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like ripples in a pond, a target object or situation can often create “ghost” or “echo” images. These items are not necessarily exactly what you are striving for. Though, it might (truthfully) be exactly what you are asking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if the navigation goal is &amp;ldquo;live in a brand new white room, eat whatever you want, close to the sea&amp;rdquo;, the target reality may be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You live in a brand new seaside prison, but the food there is good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You become a sailor and spend most of your time in a white cabin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is not impossible to become a food tycoon and live in a seaside villa. But if no restrictions are set, the navigation direction will be towards the world line that is closest and most likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A false positive is that you have become a food industry tycoon and live in a beachfront villa, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your villa is very humid, and the sea breeze causes water and salt to cover the walls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The shrinking food industry has caused you to be heavily in debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no beach at the beach, and there are strong winds and huge waves all year round&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the goal seems to have been achieved, but there are many problems. At this time, you need to make a course correction and make necessary adjustments to some details. The good news is that a false positive means that you have reached the world line cluster where the goal is located. By modifying the content of the Affirmation and spending more time, reality will get closer to the goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The house is comfortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The climate here is pleasant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The industry is booming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, time passes, and you get where you want to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

        <title>The Boring MBTI System</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/the-boring-mbti-system/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/the-boring-mbti-system/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be helpful to describe how my attitude towards MBTI has changed over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the MBTI framework offers a compelling way to understand personality patterns, it ultimately simplifies the complexity of human behavior into static categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are dynamic, and their thoughts, actions, and motivations often shift with context, age, and experience. There are also huge differences between people in their ability and degree to control their thoughts. Therefore the binary system created by MBTI is an extremely simplified system that is easy to understand but is not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we must take into account the complexity of the system and try to conduct research in a more fitting way. Classification will inevitably lead to bias, and this bias in the MBTI system has the probability of stereotyping people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limitations of the MBTI are already quite obvious, and it is clear that it constrains many people, both in terms of behavior and potential. I tend to believe that individuals are unique and special, and trying to describe all individuals using 16 types is a very simplified and easy to understand way, which is what makes it so popular, but it does not represent its accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People always want something to be fixed, but reality is often dynamic. It is understandable that seeking to fix reality is a lazy behavior, and this is also true for psychological research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good example of individual peculiarity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Anime Review: Violet Evergarden</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/anime-review-violet-evergarden/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/anime-review-violet-evergarden/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/anime-review-violet-evergarden/VE4.png" alt="Featured image of post Anime Review: Violet Evergarden" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sincerely thank the authors of Kyoto Animation and take this opportunity to remember the lives lost in the fire in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven years later, Violet has become a classic, and she is a well-deserved legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violet is not a real person, but her existence is far more real than many real people. Every time I mention this name, I seem to be standing in front of the red-walled post office that is gradually covered by modern civilization, holding a yellowed letter in my hand, and looking up I can see the half-finished Eiffel Tower and the old times that are gradually fading away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;May your heart be conveyed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Violet&amp;rsquo;s lifelong wish - she wants to be a person who can &amp;ldquo;transmit love.&amp;rdquo; We find it difficult to accept her departure because she is as familiar as a family member, as close as a friend, and as warm as light. We believe that she is the legendary doll who once lived in this world, and appreciate her aristocratic behavior. We are happy that she can use a knife and fork skillfully, sad that she wants to strangle herself when she learns that the major is missing, amazed by her light footsteps on the lake, and moved by her saying without exception that &amp;ldquo;there is no letter that does not need to be delivered&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rarely rate anime characters as &amp;ldquo;great&amp;rdquo;, but Violet is a truly great character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the character who was still accompanying us viewers not long ago, the gentle and powerful, powerful and sad person, is already a century of history. Her story is rarely known, and her figure is already the purple ink on a special stamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her, there is no more Auto-Memory Doll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a legend of the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know this is a fictional story but are unwilling to admit it, we know this is a utopian obsession but are unwilling to give up, just like the line in Violet Evergarden: &amp;ldquo;You know it&amp;rsquo;s not real? But you feel like you are there, sometimes happy, sometimes sad, why? Because you resonate with the protagonist in the story!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memory of civilization is essentially the urns of millions of Violet Evergarden, and we all live in the embers after she burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw Violet holding up an umbrella and becoming the girl stepping lightly on the lake, but we consciously ignored her gorgeous clothes that got soaked a few seconds later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violet is not a god, nor is she a tool, but a person as her name suggests. She turned the burning fire of karma into a mission to convey love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that she is fictional, but we all want to believe that she really existed. We all look forward to walking into that world one day, seeing the cottage by the sea, seeing scattered letters, hearing the sound of typewriters and metal prostheses, and perhaps we will gently say: &amp;ldquo;Thank you, Violet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why she is &amp;ldquo;great&amp;rdquo; is that she represents the ultimate purity of an emotion, a power that still lives towards the light in loss and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can come out of pain and become a more gentle existence; people can learn slowly through letters when they don&amp;rsquo;t know what love is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violet Evergarden, she is not immortal, she is just an ordinary girl who once survived the war, stained with blood but longing for love. But the places she walked, the letters she wrote, and the people she accompanied, are like the traces of stars falling in the night sky. Although short-lived, no one will forget that in that era when people could only communicate through letters, there was an 18-year-old girl who was fulfilling the mission of conveying love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her name is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violet Evergarden&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Intention &amp; Navigation in MWI</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intention-navigation-in-mwi/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intention-navigation-in-mwi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Released on April 1st, take it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our thoughts control our reality. So if we want to live a “much improved” life, in whatever way we choose, we can manifest it. By understanding the way the universe works, the nature of consciousness, and the role thought has, you can pick and choose world-line destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that you can direct your consciousness into the craziest, most complex worldline situations you can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that it takes time to manifest through world lines. The more outrageous the intention and desire, the farther the target world line is, and the more world boundaries your consciousness needs to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to obtain the reality we want to inhabit, whatever that is, we need to develop a plan to make that happen. We need to navigate our consciousness through adjacent realities in order to eventually reach our final destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;fundamentals&#34;&gt;Fundamentals
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be able to do this, we need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A map, plan, or schedule of where we want to go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastery of our thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planning---a-map&#34;&gt;Planning - A Map
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are always surprises when doing many things, no matter how big or small. The difficulty of a project is sometimes not well anticipated, and the same is true for world line navigation. Unless you are careful, the reality you live in may have all kinds of surprises. There, it is prudent for you to be careful and concerned when drawing the destination world line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following scenario,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are currently in worldline reality &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo;. It is shown in green.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You eventually want to reach a new reality &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo;. It is shown in gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are two paths marked. One is yellow and one is black.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intention-navigation-in-mwi/WLT01.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1024&#34;
	height=&#34;454&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intention-navigation-in-mwi/WLT01_hu_d105dc7be7416060.png 480w, https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intention-navigation-in-mwi/WLT01_hu_288dc5903388a789.png 1024w&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;225&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;541px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yellow path is the most direct path. It will require fewer adjacent realities to pass through. The black path is the preferred path. It will take longer, because you will need to pass through more adjacent realities to get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that you want to take the black path over the yellow path is so that you can avoid those problematic realities. They are shown in grey. These realities will bring you turmoil and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when planning, there are a number of factors you need to be absolutely sure of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A destination lifestyle. Clear and easy to visualize. It must be very detailed. There must be no ambiguity in it what so ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporate elements that will guarantee avoidance of problematic adjacent realities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mastery-of-our-thoughts&#34;&gt;Mastery of our thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is to navigate the map we create above, which is often difficult to do because we need to control our thoughts, and modern life does not allow this. All the “fake news,” every ad you see, and all the thoughts of everyone around you influence your thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see that if you want to make your planned end destination a reality, you&amp;rsquo;re going to need to shut down those bad thought streams. That means breaking some long-formed habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;intention&#34;&gt; Intention
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prayer, directed thought, and focus are all great tools, as are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A visualization creation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a listing of what you want&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pray / visualize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a point to alert against bad realities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note that the resulting reality will not be exact. It will be very close to what you want, but you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to specify exact people and exact locations, nor a very constructive level of detail. If you focus on your baseline wishes and desires, the rest will automatically fill in. Of course, it will get more and more accurate over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release&#34;&gt;Release
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what many people believe, this requires a period of forced inactivity. Resting, not doing anything, not even thinking about these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, without this period of stagnation, nothing would happen. After you wind up the car, you can&amp;rsquo;t let it go until it moves forward. If you wind it up all the time, it will stay where it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variables that will influence the timing of reality manifestation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How different and “far out” your goal is from your current reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thoughts and habits that you currently have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thoughts of those around you, especially those of family members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The discipline that you have in doing all of this to make your new world-line realized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-avoid-the-news&#34;&gt;Why avoid the news
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you start browsing MWI using personal intention, you’ll start to realize that all the news isn’t for you. It’s like wallpaper, it doesn’t affect your life in any way other than to scare you and make you cower in fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vocalize-it-loud&#34;&gt;Vocalize it loud
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? And why do you need to say things out loud? Why not just think things instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As consciousness moves across world lines, it switches between wave and particle form. Your thoughts occur while you are in wave form, and through vocalization you can act while you are in particle form. Vocalization not only helps direct and focus the mind, but it is also the easiest action to take, which greatly speeds up goal achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many other methods, using image boards, acting, pretending, and creating scenes. Physical action must be accompanied by directed thought to manifest, and vocalization satisfies this condition.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Law of Attraction Under MWI</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/law-of-attraction-under-mwi/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/law-of-attraction-under-mwi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/law-of-attraction-under-mwi/Law-of-Attraction.png" alt="Featured image of post Law of Attraction Under MWI" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the MWI framework, every possible self you may become and every possible fate you may experience already &amp;ldquo;exists&amp;rdquo; in the universe, but they belong to different branching world lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the process of entering and exiting world lines, through the control of thoughts, we can select and strengthen the path weights of certain world lines, so that life experience tends towards those realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every thought, emotion, intention, and belief is a &amp;ldquo;offset&amp;rdquo; operation on a certain world line. It all starts from the moment consciousness comes into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive, confident, and determined thinking → makes you more likely to move towards a world with positive results;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear, doubt, and self-denial → make you biased towards the branch with low probability and negative results;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means that when you decide to start taking control of your thoughts, you first need to face the thoughts you have had for decades, which have shaped your reality today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since consciousness actually moves in and out of different world lines, we can see that thoughts not only choose/create reality, thoughts are reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because our thoughts determine what world-lines we enter into. So if we are thinking wonderful thoughts, and are calm, and direct our energy into wonderful things, our life would be wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we surround ourselves with negative thoughts, manipulative news, and people. If we are reacting to events instead of manifesting them, or if we hold grudges and evil negative thoughts, then our world experiences will become progressively darker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts create memories, and memories influence thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poverty stricken beggar might yearn for a reality where he has a warm meal and a roof over his head from the rain. While a wealthy oligarch might yearn for forbidden activities, and serendipitous pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This difference is due to their experiences, which are shaped by their memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People discovered this phenomenon and named it the Law of Attraction. In fact, directed thoughts determine their reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once, there was an explosion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A bang which gave birth to time and space.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Once, there was an explosion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A bang which set our world spinning.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;And then, came the next explosion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An explosion that will be our last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once, there was a silence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A rift where death bled into life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Once, there was a fall.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Of cities, of bonds, of time untied.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;And then, came the walking man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With ghosts behind and hope ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once, there was a choice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To break, or bind, to flee, or find.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Once, there was a bridge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Built not of stone, but heart and mind.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;And then, came the final thread.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One soul, walking where angels dread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once, there was an explosion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ever stranding. Ever becoming.&lt;br&gt;
The rope is the hope.&lt;br&gt;
And we are the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>What is MWI</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-is-mwi/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-is-mwi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-is-mwi/0008.png" alt="Featured image of post What is MWI" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction-to-the-many-worlds-interpretation-mwi&#34;&gt;Introduction to the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics emerged in the early 20th century to explain strange behaviors at the atomic and subatomic levels—such as electrons existing in multiple states at once or particles behaving like both waves and particles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematically, quantum systems are described by a wavefunction (Ψ), which evolves deterministically over time according to the Schrödinger equation. This wavefunction contains all possible outcomes of a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;copenhagen-interpretation-vs-mwi&#34;&gt;Copenhagen Interpretation vs. MWI
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the experiment we can know that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before measurement, particles exist in a &lt;strong&gt;superposition&lt;/strong&gt; of all possible states.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After measurement, we observe &lt;strong&gt;one definite outcome&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where do the results come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Copenhagen Interpretation, developed primarily by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in the 1920s, was the first and most widely accepted explanation of this puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wavefunction represents &lt;strong&gt;our knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; of a system, not objective reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a measurement is made, the wavefunction &lt;strong&gt;collapses&lt;/strong&gt; into a single outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior to observation, physical properties are &lt;strong&gt;undefined&lt;/strong&gt; or &amp;ldquo;potential.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is clear that the Copenhagen interpretation suffers from a great deal of ambiguity: it has no clear way of defining “observation” or the observer, nor does it explain what actually exists before the observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1957, physicist Hugh Everett III proposed the Many-Worlds Interpretation as a clean, deterministic alternative to Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this theory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wavefunction &lt;strong&gt;never collapses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All possible outcomes of quantum events &lt;strong&gt;actually happen&lt;/strong&gt;—in &lt;strong&gt;separate branches&lt;/strong&gt; of the universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measurement causes &lt;strong&gt;decoherence&lt;/strong&gt;, not collapse: the world &amp;ldquo;splits&amp;rdquo; into multiple, non-interacting outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A particle in superposition doesn’t choose one outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, the universe &lt;strong&gt;branches&lt;/strong&gt;, and each outcome occurs in its own “world.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further reasoning, any &amp;ldquo;forking&amp;rdquo; behavior may not exist, but the world line corresponding to each result itself always exists, and the observer moves between these worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;schrödingers-cat&#34;&gt;Schrödinger&amp;rsquo;s Cat
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erwin Schrödinger proposed his famous thought experiment in 1935:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine a cat sealed in a box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside, there is a radioactive atom with a 50% chance to decay in one hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it decays, a Geiger counter triggers a hammer that breaks a vial of poison, killing the cat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it doesn’t decay, the cat lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Copenhagen interpretation, the system remains in superposition (cat is dead and alive) until a measurement is made. At the moment of observation, the wavefunction collapses into one of the two possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You see a &lt;strong&gt;live cat&lt;/strong&gt;, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You see a &lt;strong&gt;dead cat&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one outcome becomes real, and the other disappears. The act of observation causes reality to “choose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MWI gives a different answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cat is both dead and alive, but in different worlds.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In one &lt;strong&gt;branch&lt;/strong&gt; of the universe, the atom decays → poison is released → the cat dies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In another &lt;strong&gt;branch&lt;/strong&gt;, the atom does not decay → the poison is not released → the cat lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two outcomes both happen, in separate branches of reality. There is no collapse but decoherence, which prevents the branches from interfering with each other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you open the box, &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; also become part of the superposition:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One version of you sees a &lt;strong&gt;dead cat&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another version sees a &lt;strong&gt;live cat&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; perspective as the observer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will experience &lt;strong&gt;only one outcome&lt;/strong&gt; (say, the live cat).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;another version of you&lt;/strong&gt;, equally real, experiences the &lt;strong&gt;other&lt;/strong&gt; outcome (dead cat).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You and your alternate self now live in &lt;strong&gt;separate, non-interacting worlds&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the above content, we can find that if MWI exists, the world will be &amp;ldquo;split&amp;rdquo; all the time, and the observer will move all the time, from one world to another. For the sake of distinction, the &amp;ldquo;world&amp;rdquo; will be called &amp;ldquo;world line&amp;rdquo; to more accurately describe the history and future of each world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mwi-and-reality&#34;&gt;MWI and Reality
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MWI is a large universe of possibilities. And each possibility is a frozen moment that our consciousness briefly visits. On top of this, our consciousness is constantly moving in and out of different realities. Since each reality is its own unique worldline, we can say that we are moving in and out of different worldlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When consciousness enters an individual&amp;rsquo;s reality, this life begins a relatively fixed journey of life. Although we feel that we have free will and can choose our direction and thoughts, there are actually many invisible restrictions around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when a baby first comes into this world, it cannot walk, talk, or even crawl, and can only lie in the crib. In theory, it may try to crawl to the edge of the bed and try to crawl out, but that is extremely limited &amp;ldquo;freedom&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;start&#34;&gt;Start
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could assume that consciousness &amp;ldquo;activates&amp;rdquo; at some point early in life. For some people, this may happen in the womb; for others, it may be after birth. For most people, consciousness is unstable at first, and it may enter and leave the body from time to time until it finally stabilizes and truly integrates into this reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we draw this process on a world line diagram, it is &amp;ldquo;falling into&amp;rdquo; the world line template map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-is-mwi/0001.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-first-few-minutes&#34;&gt;The first few minutes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first few minutes, days, and months, freedom of movement is very limited. The consciousness is still learning how to move, learning how to use the body. So the actual physical activity it can do is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if it pushed itself, and it strove to overcome, it could roll, crawl, move and do other things that are very difficult to do. These difficult things can be defined as hills and mountains on the template map. Using the Z-axis, the higher the “mountain”, the harder the effort. The shallower the depression, the easier the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-is-mwi/0002.png&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;429px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, consciousness moves on this template map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the personality of consciousness, it either chooses the easy route or it becomes a &amp;ldquo;tough guy&amp;rdquo; and pushes forward, striving to &amp;ldquo;climb those mountains.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can conclude that before birth, everyone corresponds to a preset &amp;ldquo;world line template&amp;rdquo;. This template largely determines the direction of your future development. Therefore, if you do nothing and live your life naturally, your future will be roughly predictable without much deviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if you decide to climb “those hills and mountains”, what then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The height of the &amp;ldquo;mountain&amp;rdquo; is a measure of effort and deviation from the comfortable norm of the consciousness&amp;rsquo;s pre-birth worldline template. When consciousness leaves the &amp;ldquo;flat, safe&amp;rdquo; median, it will change, but the change will not be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, the pre-birth worldline template will still remain pretty much the same. The consciousness will &amp;ldquo;climb that mountain&amp;rdquo; and then discover other areas that were originally forbidden to it, i.e., possibilities that were originally unreachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the above inferences, it can be concluded that the location of entry into the template is very critical, which will determine how much effort the consciousness needs to put in to reach where they want to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;glossary&#34;&gt;Glossary
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;time&#34;&gt;Time
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the MWI, consciousness is constantly moving between worldlines, so what we call &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo; is actually the experience and process of consciousness moving through the MWI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, each consciousness experiences their own version of &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo;, which is determined by the speed at which the consciousness travels between worldlines. A &amp;ldquo;unified&amp;rdquo; time exists within a single worldline, but this is of no help to consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;life-line&#34;&gt;Life-Line
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A “life-line” is a collection of experiences that a consciousness has. As the consciousness moves in and out of individual moments of time, it creates a path. This path looks like a vector. It starts at the moment of birth and ends at the moment of death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;world-line&#34;&gt;World-Line
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &amp;ldquo;world line&amp;rdquo; is a frozen moment, like a photograph. It contains its unique history and future. The history and future of each world line are different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as using the world-line map template, each intersection point, dot or globe represents one such world-line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;world-line-cluster&#34;&gt;World-Line Cluster
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the number of consciousnesses is finite, but the number of worldlines is close to infinite, then the probability that each consciousness has its own worldline is greatest. In other words, shared worldlines are rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as the consciousness travels on the MWI it does so based upon it’s thoughts. If others share the same thoughts, they travel the MWI in a similar manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you map out the Time-Lines of people who are sharing similar thoughts, you will find that they seem to travel together, and they seem to experience the same World-lines. Which known as clustering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;echo-chamber&#34;&gt;Echo Chamber
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In discussions of news media, an echo chamber refers to situations in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system and insulated from rebuttal. By participating in an echo chamber, people are able to seek out information that reinforces their existing views without encountering opposing views, potentially resulting in an unintended exercise in confirmation bias. Echo chambers may increase social and political polarization and extremism.
-Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you only listen to a certain type of &amp;ldquo;news&amp;rdquo; and only receive opinions from others who agree with you, your thoughts will be reinforced into a set narrative and you will not be able to think other thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of MWI, it is dangerous to be in a closed environment where thoughts are set to &amp;ldquo;be in a rut&amp;rdquo;. It locks you into a path and drives you to a set place in MWI, whether good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;template-map&#34;&gt;Template Map
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The template map is a model used to visualize how consciousness moves in MWI. It can be thought of as a topological map, made up of grid intersections, each of which represents a &amp;ldquo;world line&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shape of the map surface reflects the most likely path a consciousness can move through its physical body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The height of the terrain represents the difficulty of movement. Flat areas symbolize easy movement without much effort, while &amp;ldquo;mountains&amp;rdquo; represent extremely high difficulties and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;pre-birth-world-line-template-map&#34;&gt;Pre-Birth World-Line Template Map
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refers to the first map that is set when a baby is born and the consciousness is injected into the body. This map is designed before the consciousness enters the material world, and its purpose is to allow the consciousness to experience a specific series of experiences in it. This is a carefully constructed specific life path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this map, the consciousness will travel along the most convenient path pre-set to experience a series of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to leave this map is to &amp;ldquo;slide&amp;rdquo; into another completely different template map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;slide&#34;&gt;Slide
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slide is an intentional change of the template map. Consciousness “slide” off the map that you are on, and land on a completely different map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this can be accomplished through design, the most effective way (on an individual basis) is to do it through thinking. By specifically controlling your thoughts to slide out of the template map, sliding to the template that is next to it, like sliding from one layer of a layer cake to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;shadow-people&#34;&gt;Shadow People
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consciousness travels through world lines alone. It is extremely rare for another consciousness to share a world line with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for a consciousness, all these &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo; it sees are actually just an empty container. They are real, and they have feelings that we react to, but its consciousness is not there, but on their own world line. This person on all other world lines is just a projection of the main consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;mountains&#34;&gt;Mountains
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the topography of a world-line template are “highs” and “lows”. These features define the difficulty of effort to move in those directions. A “mountain” is a particularly difficult are to traverse. And on the 3D map it will appear as a mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;hills&#34;&gt;Hills
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hill is similar to a mountain. It’s level of difficulty to traverse is proportionally smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;comfort-zone&#34;&gt;Comfort Zone
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In actual experience, the flat, unruffled areas on the world line template map are the so-called &amp;ldquo;comfort zones&amp;rdquo;. No matter how rugged and steep the terrain ahead looks, there will always be a relatively smooth and easy path in the world line template set before birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing is that no matter what you face in life, there is always a &amp;ldquo;default route&amp;rdquo; waiting for you to move forward; it may be smooth or difficult, but it always exists.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>No More US.KG</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/no-more-us.kg/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/no-more-us.kg/</guid>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear User,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We regret to inform you that due to domain abuse and other related issues, after extensive discussions with the &lt;strong&gt;.KG registry&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ccltd.kg will no longer be allowed to receive any complaint reports&lt;/strong&gt;—otherwise, the &lt;strong&gt;.KG registry will permanently disable domain resolution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US.KG Domains: Current Situation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;strong&gt;US.KG DNS resolution has been temporarily re-enabled&lt;/strong&gt;, please be aware that &lt;strong&gt;if any further complaints are received, the .KG registry will immediately revoke DNS resolution again.&lt;/strong&gt; This restriction is beyond our control, as it is an official policy of the &lt;strong&gt;.KG registry&lt;/strong&gt;, not a decision made by us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, we are &lt;strong&gt;forced to suspend all US.KG domain resolutions&lt;/strong&gt;, and the ability to register new US.KG domains has been &lt;strong&gt;disabled&lt;/strong&gt;. We, &lt;strong&gt;DigitalPlat FreeDomain&lt;/strong&gt;, are also victims of this policy change and understand the inconvenience this may cause. Despite this setback, we are actively seeking better and more stable alternatives to continue providing free domain services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migration to a New Domain: DPDNS.ORG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure service continuity, we are &lt;strong&gt;introducing a new domain: dpdns.org&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example:&lt;/strong&gt; If your previous domain was &lt;code&gt;example.us.kg&lt;/code&gt;, your account will be &lt;strong&gt;automatically switched&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;code&gt;example.dpdns.org&lt;/code&gt; once the new system is ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important Notice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dpdns.org is still under testing&lt;/strong&gt; and is &lt;strong&gt;NOT available for resolution, management, or new registrations yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;wait for our official announcement&lt;/strong&gt; before making any changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to abuse, US.KG has stopped serving. This website will be moved to dpdns.org. &lt;code&gt;entropiex.us.kg&lt;/code&gt; will be replaced by &lt;code&gt;entropiex.dpdns.org&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This document aims to systematically organize and summarize the core concepts related to the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) to help build a more complete understanding of the nature of reality. To facilitate thinking and communication, several simplified models and analogies are used in this document. These expressions strive to be close to reality, but they do not represent the only or final explanation. Please note: reality is far more complex than the model, and you should avoid construction as much as possible when reading this document.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Encryption Plugin</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/new-encryption-plugin/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/new-encryption-plugin/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/new-encryption-plugin/first.png" alt="Featured image of post New Encryption Plugin" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an Obsidian plugin development plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Meld Encrypt has a very bad interactive design. Every time a user selects a file in the file browser, the file preview function will show an overview of the file content. At this time, Meld Encrypt will automatically pop up a password box, which must be closed manually to continue looking for files. This is very bad - most of the time, the mouse just hovers for a while to trigger this troublesome password input box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Meld Encrypt is very slow when switching during decryption, and occasionally undecrypted garbled characters will appear, which threatens the smooth Obsidian experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I decided to develop a new lightweight plugin that has all the functions of Meld Encrypt, but is faster, safer and more stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new encryption plugin will also introduce asymmetric encryption technology. Perhaps elliptic curves are a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>INTJ: Born Achiever and Loser</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intj-born-achiever-and-loser/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intj-born-achiever-and-loser/</guid>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;pathway-of-an-intj&#34;&gt;Pathway of an INTJ
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;lower-stage&#34;&gt;Lower stage
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lower stage, the INTJ usually presents as a being weaker than ordinary people. They have extraordinary self-confidence and arrogance, look down on everything, are introverted, like to think about problems but often dare not really be independent, their grades cannot crush their classmates, they have not carried out large-scale learning and self-discipline, and their thoughts are not objective, materialistic, and practical. They have no ability to counteract these huge side effects of being an INTJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transition-l-m&#34;&gt;Transition L-M
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After experiencing a mental transformation (usually a breakdown and remodeling) caused by long-term thinking, they realize that arrogance and coldness are not conducive to achieving their goals, so they try to become more humble and use personality masks. As they gradually have a concept of their goals and the path in between, INTJs at this stage will improve their ability to act and their thirst for knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;middle-stage&#34;&gt;Middle stage
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A middle stage INTJ possesses high intelligence, deep philosophical thinking, and strong self-discipline. They can analyze most things clearly and independently resolve various peculiar thoughts. Having dedicated thousands or even tens of thousands of hours to learning, they have developed exceptional decision-making, judgment, and perception through extensive reading, far surpassing the accuracy of ordinary individuals. Their academic performance and achievements exceed those of most peers. Becoming more social and communicative, fearless in standing out, and establish rules and order for their teams. Able to control time and energy in certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transition-m-h&#34;&gt;Transition M-H
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This stage has approached or achieved success in a secular sense, and after several years of development, has made outstanding contributions or achievements in a specific field. Gradually, they have acquired high-level rationality and the ability to predict the times, breaking free from the limitations of emotional and physical basic feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;higher-stage&#34;&gt;Higher stage
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher stage INTJs are built on top rationality, understand the laws of the world, have accurate long-term prediction capabilities, learning abilities, and terrifying execution capabilities. High stage INTJs are only limited by their physical and time limits, so they usually reach the pinnacle in a field, can thoroughly study the things they love and influence others, can soar to the sky in good times, and can turn the tide in bad times. They dare to be unique and are not afraid of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;置之死地而后生&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;置之死地而后生&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People like and admire INTJs, but only high-level INTJs. Their decisiveness, perseverance, and courage are highly praised, and their near-absolute rationality is called a miracle. However, the more perfect these abilities are, the deeper the gap between the middle and high levels is. The M-H stage will be a hurdle that most people will never be able to cross in their lifetime, and it is also the stage that only a few top entrepreneurs, politicians, and financial tycoons can overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INTJ&amp;rsquo;s aversion to stupidity and their own arrogance make them more accepted by society the higher they are. For lower- and middle-stage INTJs, accepting the reality of being weak, being open-minded and objective, studying as diligently as possible, and always being optimistic are the only ways to reach a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interesting-vs-meaningful&#34;&gt;Interesting vs. Meaningful
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;external-rules-and-influences&#34;&gt;External rules and influences
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTJ&amp;rsquo;s instinct is to pursue efficiency. If they don&amp;rsquo;t see the meaning of something, they won&amp;rsquo;t even take a second look at it in order to &amp;ldquo;maximize efficiency.&amp;rdquo; However, what many people think of as &amp;ldquo;meaningful&amp;rdquo; is actually based on external rules, such as getting into a good school, finding a good job, and winning social recognition. These are value systems defined by others, and are &amp;ldquo;finite games&amp;rdquo; that will eventually fall into endless competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;finite-games-vs-infinite-games&#34;&gt;Finite games vs. infinite games
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of a finite game is to win, so the rules are clear and there are many competitors, leading to involution. The goal of an infinite game is to continue and explore, and the rules can be created, so the competitive pressure is much smaller. INTJs have the advantages of systematic thinking and strategic planning, and can completely choose not to get involved in the established track, but to establish their own game rules, enter the “wilderness”, and open up their own path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;find-something-that-is-truly-interesting&#34;&gt;Find something that is truly “interesting”
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTJs tend to execute efficiently, but their thinking framework is often driven by external goals, which easily leads to them just optimizing the existing system and ignoring the possibility of creating a new system. To find something “interesting”, the key is to slow down, return to life, and observe which things can make you invest in it for a long time even without external rewards. In other words, if something doesn&amp;rsquo;t need external recognition and you&amp;rsquo;re still willing to work on it, then it may be worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-value-of-time&#34;&gt;The value of time
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For INTJs, time is the most valuable resource. The real strategy is not to fight for a tiny advantage in a highly competitive race, but to find areas that have not yet been noticed by the mainstream, set your own rules there, and become a rule maker rather than a passive player in the game. This not only improves the return on investment (ROI), but also conforms to INTJ&amp;rsquo;s long-term planning mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;supplement&#34;&gt;Supplement
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In business, breadth is a cost, and depth is a profit. For INTJs, the requirements are even more stringent. They must be both generalists and experts, understand all walks of life, and be the best in their own profession. This puts a double test on time and body, which is one of the reasons why top successful people are so rare.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ASI 2030</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/asi-2030/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/asi-2030/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/asi-2030/RSI-NewBabbage.png" alt="Featured image of post ASI 2030" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If AGI/ASI is truly one of the biggest changes in human history, then it’s important to know the worst-case scenario. If they do come to pass, it will be a darker future than Cyberpunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;technology-evolution-timeline&#34;&gt;Technology Evolution Timeline
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025-2030&lt;/strong&gt;: AGI emerges, leading to the large-scale replacement of standardized intellectual work. Humans retain only symbolic decision-making power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2031-2035&lt;/strong&gt;: ASI achieves breakthroughs, taking over strategic decision-making. Corporate CEOs become mere &amp;ldquo;AI interpreters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2036-2045&lt;/strong&gt;: Human-machine integration becomes essential for survival. Those without neural implants are marginalized. Consciousness uploading becomes the new class divide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-stratification&#34;&gt;Social Stratification
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruling Class (0.01%)&lt;/strong&gt;: Controls computing power, engages in genetic optimization, and profits from time differentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Class (9.99%)&lt;/strong&gt;: Maintains human-machine interactions, optimizes data value, and exploits AI vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disposable Class (90%)&lt;/strong&gt;: Provides data, virtual labor, or serves as &amp;ldquo;biological containers&amp;rdquo; for consciousness uploads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;control-over-key-resources&#34;&gt;Control Over Key Resources
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computing power is monopolized by oligarchs, capable of instantly wiping out dissenters&amp;rsquo; assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data becomes the new form of enslavement—ordinary individuals generate data but cannot profit from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time is commodified—the wealthy can store their consciousness, while the poor must sign &amp;ldquo;time debt&amp;rdquo; contracts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-prediction&#34;&gt;Final Prediction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;2045&lt;/strong&gt;, AI computing power surpasses the singularity threshold. Decisions made before 2030 will determine the survival conditions of 2045.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be a highly algorithm-driven and computationally dominated future, where social stratification will be even more extreme than it is today. Energy, biotechnology, and AI will all develop rapidly, and the living space of ordinary people will be greatly compressed. From an individual perspective, the only way out is to act quickly and strive for a proactive position before the ASI era arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously a lot of things need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free subdomain provider US.KG has once again been temporarily suspended from resolving by the Kyrgyzstan registry.
The reason for the suspension remains consistent with the previous instance: the free nature of the domain has attracted numerous cybercriminal gangs using it to create phishing and malicious websites.&lt;br&gt;
Typically, domain registries take action upon receiving excessive complaints, which can include suspending resolution, seizing, and reclaiming domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since DigitalPlat has suspended domain name resolution, the website will temporarily use the original Github Pages domain name (enthalpiex.github.io).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Occam&#39;s Razor and Bayesianism</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/occams-razor-and-bayesianism/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/occams-razor-and-bayesianism/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In simple models and complex models, as long as the simple model is consistent with the results, its confidence is much higher than that of the complex model. When this gap is infinitely magnified by multiple parameters, from the perspective of Bayesian probability, the simple model is either directly rejected, but as long as it can roughly match the experimental data, it is better than the complex model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes 2 parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;occams-razor-and-bayesianism&#34;&gt;Occam&amp;rsquo;s Razor and Bayesianism
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occam&amp;rsquo;s Razor&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Bayesianism&lt;/strong&gt; are two important principles in reasoning and scientific philosophy. Occam’s Razor emphasizes &lt;strong&gt;simplicity&lt;/strong&gt;, favoring explanations that introduce the fewest unnecessary assumptions. Bayesianism, on the other hand, focuses on probabilistic reasoning, continuously updating our beliefs based on new evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;occams-razor-favoring-simpler-explanations&#34;&gt;Occam’s Razor: Favoring Simpler Explanations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occam’s Razor states that &lt;strong&gt;when multiple explanations exist, the simplest one is usually the best&lt;/strong&gt;. This idea was introduced by the 14th-century philosopher &lt;strong&gt;William of Ockham&lt;/strong&gt;, who argued that we should avoid unnecessary complexity in our reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if a strange noise is heard at night, one could assume either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was caused by the wind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was caused by ghosts moving objects around the house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occam’s Razor suggests choosing the first explanation because it relies on well-understood natural causes rather than introducing additional, unproven assumptions. While simplicity alone does not guarantee correctness, it often leads to more practical and testable theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bayesianism-updating-beliefs-based-on-evidence&#34;&gt;Bayesianism: Updating Beliefs Based on Evidence
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayesianism is a way of reasoning that helps us refine our beliefs as we gather more information. Instead of treating ideas as either absolutely true or false, it considers different possibilities and adjusts how likely each one is based on new evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if a doctor suspects a patient has a certain illness, they do not immediately confirm it. Instead, they look at symptoms, test results, and medical history, gradually becoming more confident in a diagnosis as more information is gathered.&lt;br&gt;
If new evidence contradicts the initial assumption, the doctor revises their belief and considers other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is widely used in fields such as science, machine learning, and even everyday decision-making. It allows us to make better predictions and avoid jumping to conclusions too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-relationship-between-o-and-b&#34;&gt;The Relationship Between O. and B.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More complex explanations usually have lower initial credibility.&lt;/strong&gt; When we lack strong evidence, it makes sense to assume simpler explanations are more likely, aligning with Occam’s Razor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bayesian reasoning naturally favors simpler theories unless the evidence strongly supports a more complex one.&lt;/strong&gt; If two explanations fit the data equally well, the simpler one is usually more likely to be correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>World Trends and Crisis Study</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/world-trends-and-crisis-study/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/world-trends-and-crisis-study/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been looking for the future direction recently, so I studied the development of the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1950 to 2025, a significant economic crisis or major economic adjustment occurs approximately every 10 years. During this period, the global economy has undergone an evolution from post-war reconstruction, technological innovation, market-oriented reforms to informatization and globalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-1950s-postwar-reconstruction-and-economic-prosperity&#34;&gt;1. 1950s: Postwar reconstruction and economic prosperity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the end of World War II, the world entered a period of post-war reconstruction. The economies of Western Europe and Japan recovered rapidly, and the United States became the global economic leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-1960s-technological-innovation-and-social-change&#34;&gt;2. 1960s: Technological innovation and social change
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technological advances (such as computers and aerospace) and social movements (such as the civil rights movement and the counterculture) flourished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-1970s-oil-crisis-and-economic-stagflation&#34;&gt;3. 1970s: Oil crisis and economic stagflation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) imposed an oil embargo, causing oil prices to soar and triggering global economic stagflation (high inflation and high unemployment coexisting). Two oil shocks in 1973 and 1979 led to a slowdown in global economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-1980s-market-oriented-reforms-and-globalization&#34;&gt;4. 1980s: Market-oriented reforms and globalization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many countries have implemented market-oriented reforms and liberalization policies, and the process of globalization has accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-1990s-information-technology-revolution-and-economic-prosperity&#34;&gt;5. 1990s: Information technology revolution and economic prosperity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information technology (IT) revolution has driven global economic growth, and the Internet and digital transformation have become mainstream. The Asian financial crisis in 1997 had an impact on emerging market countries, but the global economy generally maintained growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-2000s-global-financial-crisis-and-economic-adjustment&#34;&gt;6. 2000s: Global financial crisis and economic adjustment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT exploded in developing countries, and the global financial market became highly integrated. The Internet winter in 2001 and the global financial crisis in 2008 led to a global economic recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-2010s-post-crisis-era-and-the-rise-of-emerging-markets&#34;&gt;7. 2010s: Post-crisis era and the rise of emerging markets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries implemented stimulus policies, and the global economy gradually recovered. Emerging market countries such as China rose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-2020s-pandemic-and-economic-reconstruction&#34;&gt;8. 2020s: Pandemic and economic reconstruction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a global health crisis, giving rise to remote work and digital transformation. In 2020, the global economy contracted significantly due to the pandemic, and countries subsequently implemented stimulus policies to promote recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Embedded Systems Engineering</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/embedded-systems-engineering/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/embedded-systems-engineering/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/embedded-systems-engineering/Embedded%20Systems%20Engineering%20Roadmap.png" alt="Featured image of post Embedded Systems Engineering" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware is hard? Then go for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2025, I did some research about future opportunities, and seems like AI can replace most single-ability people in a not far future. The block chain technology and models led by transformers are now a large market and are still expanding. Unfortunately, just like the Internet boom, the best time has passed, so I need to find something still useful in future, and I realized that the combination of hardware and software that embedded development provide is one of the strongest ability I have seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until AI can directly control the real world, micro-quantum computers appear, and brain-computer interfaces have the ability to inherit memory, embedded development will always exist - because all current electronic industry are built on the basis of embedded development. The decline of embedded means the rise of a new generation of computers with non-von Neumann architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Science alone is too boring for me. For this reason, in 2025 I decided to start learning everything about embedded development. This will be another new starting point after I acquire the ability to design for additive manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Future</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/future/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/future/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s January again! Happy new year to you all guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s electronic products are thinner and lighter than before, but they are still very heavy, especially those laptops with good performance that weigh more than one kilogram. Today’s quantum computers are larger and heavier than traditional computers—they are housed in specific rooms and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prompts us to ask: what kinds of products could define the future? Can we experience the same level of excitement as we did with groundbreaking releases like the MacBook or the iPhone X?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One promising candidate is AR glasses powered by directional beam charging technology. Currently, most AR glasses fail to replace smartphones, primarily due to their weight, with bulky batteries being the main culprit. Since this, if we can cancel the battery and use a power bank to charge, also replace the wire to wireless RF (radio frequency) technology, such as millimeter-wave directional transmission, all above problems will be solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenges are: heating problem, high energy consumption ratio chip and High-resolution transparent display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same technology has the potential to revolutionize aerospace. Traditional space elevators are constrained by material limitations. By eliminating these materials and instead using ion thrusters with vector control to maintain a fixed orbit, coupled with wireless RF technology for power transmission, we could bypass these constraints entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would pave the way for a low-Earth orbit transportation method far more efficient than traditional rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of technology is brimming with possibilities, although we feel like the technological progress has gradually slowed down or even stalled, but in fact there are still many conceptual technologies that have not been widely used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Timespy prefers GPU scores, limiting CPU power consumption and increasing GPU clock frequency as much as possible &lt;strong&gt;successfully allows Flow X13 to compete head-on with gaming laptops that are twice as heavy as it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In comparison, the Timespy score of a 110W RTX4060 gaming laptop is 10500.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the release of Flow X13, I wanted to achieve a Timespy score of more than 10000 at a weight of 1.3kg, and Flow X13 gave me this possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symbolism of this record is far greater than its practicality, because you obviously can&amp;rsquo;t always use a laptop in the Arctic, and the CPU will compete with the GPU for power consumption. But I think this is the direction of future electronic products, extreme compactness and extreme performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why is there no Flow disclosure in 2025? Is it going to be released in the middle of the year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I hope this experiment can help all Flow X13 users.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the theoretical part, please see this post:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/FlowX13/comments/1hrdlmd/revitalize_your_flow_x13_in_2025_0_cost/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-improve-performance&#34;&gt;How To Improve Performance
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING: The tutorial has certain risks, please see the end of the article.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview-1&#34;&gt;Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is the first day of 2025, I wish you all a happy new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before CES 2025, I am sure that Flow X13 2023 will still be the only one of its size, because the 60Hz screen of PX13 is really not flattering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow X13 balances everything: battery life, screen, CPU, graphics card, weight&amp;hellip; Despite this, it is still difficult to compete with traditional gaming laptops due to its size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with the release of many laptops in 2023 and 2024, it has become a reality for Flow X13 to achieve the default performance of gaming laptops. Today, the performance of the RTX4060 version will be very close to the level of access to &lt;strong&gt;XG Mobile RTX3070  (or even XG Mobile RTX3080)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how&#34;&gt;How
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following examples are all based on the RTX4060 version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through testing, we can know that the power consumption allocation of Flow X13 is &lt;strong&gt;20wCPU+50wGPU&lt;/strong&gt;. At this time, the core temperature is kept about &lt;strong&gt;80℃,&lt;/strong&gt; which means that the scheduling is very conservative, so the primary goal is to use up all cooling redundancy. At this time, the maximum GPU frequency is only 1800MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By flashing vBIOS, you can change the graphics card power consumption and scheduling strategy. Please Google how to flash vBIOS, I will not repeat it here. If you encounter green screen or blue screen problems, please try to change the nvflash version and avoid using GPU-Z to back up your vBIOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flashing vBIOS is risky, please make sure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Back up the original vBIOS file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The GPU mode is Hybrid Output Mode (cGPU+dGPU) when flashing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The flashed vBIOS is safe and supports Dedicated GPU Direct Output Mode and Hybrid Output Mode, otherwise your computer might become a paperweight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. vBIOS Device ID is &amp;ldquo;10DE 28E0&amp;rdquo; (Check your original device ID and choose vBIOS with same ID)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Reinstall the correct driver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;where&#34;&gt;Where
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few tested vBIOS to choose from:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alienware RTX 4060 vBIOS (TGP 70~75W)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/265890/265890&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Not recommended but optional: (Exceeding thermal limits)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo RTX 4060 vBIOS (TGP 90~100W) &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/259213/259213&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-configure-g-helper&#34;&gt;How to configure G-Helper
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I used the vBIOS of the 70W Alienware X14R2 (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/265890/265890&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;VGA Bios Collection: Alienware RTX 4060 Mobile 8 GB | TechPowerUp&lt;/a&gt;) to adjust the GPU Clock Limit through G-helper and drew the energy efficiency curve of the Flow X13 4060M graphics card:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also as we all know, the power consumption and frequency of RTX 4060 Mobile are closely related:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;RTX 4060 Mobile 80W&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;1545-1890 MHz&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RTX 4060 Mobile 90W&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1620-2010 MHz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RTX 4060 Mobile 105W&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2115-2250 MHz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RTX 4060 Mobile 115W&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2295-2370 MHz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/flow-x13-timespy-world-record/T_2.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1080&#34;
	height=&#34;516&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;502px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the figure, we can see that the CPU has the best performance when limited to 60 watts, and overclocking the graphics card will reduce some CPU performance. This is because the total power consumption is limited to ~125W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, you can save power by limiting the graphics card clock frequency and confirm its performance according to the table, while limiting the CPU to 60W can maximize utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computer has not undergone any hardware modification, the test date is January 1, 2025, 130W original power supply, and the driver version is 555.97. The test environment is room temperature 20~25 ℃, and the computer is placed on a laptop stand to raise it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-1&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, the Flow X13 4070&amp;rsquo;s Timespy score is up to 9440, with a CPU score of 10681 and a GPU score of 9251. The maximum speed of Flow X13 factory vBIOS is 8800, so you can get at least 10% performance improvement for free by using this method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is this really the limit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;warning&#34;&gt;Warning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure cooling redundancy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing a GPU beyond its design limits significantly stresses the VRM, particularly the high-side FETs, increasing the risk of failure. GPU core failures in laptops are rarely caused by core VRM issues. Instead, failures often stem from the vRAM VRM impacting the core or, more commonly, from CPU VRM failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even though this post is intended to improve performance without any modifications, to mitigate this situation, I strongly recommend upgrading to high-performance thermal putty, shim components, or improve thermal contact with the bottom panel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When improving the bottom panel contact make sure you use an additional heat sink to remove the heat from the baseplate. If you don&amp;rsquo;t do this then this modification will have little effect other than making the baseplate hotter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After testing, when the Timespy score of the unmodified Flow X13 was 10,000 points (±100), the stress test stability was only 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Per Aspera Ad Astra, which refers &amp;ldquo;Through suffering to the stars&amp;rdquo;. The specific object of suffering here is still a mystery to me, but it may be a little clearer now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite Chinese translation of this sentence is &amp;ldquo;历尽艰辛，终抵群星&amp;rdquo; (After going through all the hardships, one will finally reach the stars). The brilliance of the second half is easy to understand, but the first half is too vague. What is suffering refers to? Make the right choice at the right time, sacrifice the minor to save the major in critical moment, doing things that are useful but painful, or trying to force progress when motivation is weak?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolate pain may be a great method to avoid it influence the motivation and energy, but what’s interesting is that the isolation method itself also consumes energy. Is this a loss-making exercise or a way to save the greater good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I believe that the final answer will be complex, because of this complicated world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Makes Action Hard?</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-makes-action-hard/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-makes-action-hard/</guid>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hard-to-start&#34;&gt;Hard to start?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find that many times I can’t start something because there is so much resistance that stops me. Since this I decided to find reasons out and trying to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m curious that where is the resistance comes from, and why it appears. Instead, I find following majority reasons, and I listed some solutions or examples I had now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fear&#34;&gt;Fear
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear is considered to be a survival instinct of human beings since ancient times. This instinct could help to protect individuals when they see the unknow beast, and they will run away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same as the modern people, when individuals meets a unknow thing, they will instinctively flee rather than fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Break down the target into small steps, see what needs to be done in each step (for example, writing an article requires different paragraphs), and make an outline to know everything you need to do. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sometimes a long outline itself can cause fear, so start by focusing on a specific section and giving it a suitable deadline is a good choice. Although deadlines are the first productivity, overly strict deadlines can cause fear and prevent from taking actions. Deadline can be brought forward after the start (e.g. to cut the time in half to improve efficiency), but it cannot be postponed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;If the above doesn&#39;t work, it means the subdivisions are not simple enough. So try to repeat the above steps for each subdivitions until they do not cause any stress or burden.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For tasks with a fixed deadline, try to at least cut the time in half to be more efficient. If the fixed deadline itself is difficult to accomplish, try to start working on it once everything are listed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;risk-cost-and-benefits-are-not-equal-or-unpredictable&#34;&gt;Risk, cost and benefits are not equal, or unpredictable
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all things have their corresponding sacrifice. Usually time, money, and energy. All things and experience are exchanging between the individual and the world, use currencies above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are forced to pay something so most of them couldn&amp;rsquo;t accept failure. If they fail, they lose all the stuff they invested. For most people, the benefits are limited, but everything they put in makes them feel physically or psychologically uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, people tend to choose stop, or even avoid to start due trying to avoid predictable risks, which is a part of the survival instinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most things, the total amount of things completed remains the same, the time is reduced, and the energy spent is increased. So there is a limit to the sum of time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this sum is limited, the different distribution of the two will greatly affect the ability to act. More energy and shorter time will cause fear, vice versa. This is because compare to the time, energy limit is more obvious and easier to feel. Less time also refers to have less time to resolve unexpected issues, which stands for bigger risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Give a looser deadline at the beginning to reduce fear, move deadline forward after start to increase efficiency.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For those things doesn&#39;t have high benefits relatively, find out its urgency and significance to replace the benefits part. If none of the above is true, avoid doing this useless thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unclear-direction&#34;&gt;Unclear direction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some individuals may have a big goal but many without details. Not enough details refers unknow, which means fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, unclear direction will stop people to trying to start because they don&amp;rsquo;t know where and how to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Break things down into enough detail and make an outline so you know what needs to be done and how to get started.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For unknown parts, search to obtain content and solutions, calculating impacts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-interesting&#34;&gt;Not interesting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain likes interesting things and dislikes boring things. When people have more interesting options, the brain will try to choose the interesting thing that is useless, rather than the useful but boring thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things are indeed useful, but the way they are done is boring, so psychological resistance will be generated to try to prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Find a more interesting way to finish the thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;If the most efficient way to do the thing is not interesting, reduce relative fun. For example, reduce entertainment or ban cell phones (Reduce activities that are considered the most interesting to narrow the gap between the fun of doing serious work and entertainment. A smaller gap will produce less resistance when doing serious work).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;All above can be summed up in one sentence:&amp;quot;Make the life pure.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 Majority reasons: Fear, Risk, cost and benefits are not equal, or unpredictable, Unclear direction, Not interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solutions:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Break down the goal and form the outline.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2. Give a looser deadline at the beginning to reduce fear, move deadline forward after start to increase efficiency.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;3. Avoid doing useless thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;4. Searching for unknow parts of plan and fill out the outline.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;5. Find a more interesting way to finish the thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;6. Reduce relative fun and make the life pure.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I do some review of my past life, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to find that I spend more time on learning, but not applying. Is this because I&amp;rsquo;m still a student, or I&amp;rsquo;m good at applying? It&amp;rsquo;s hard to find out the answer immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this could state for two possible reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have sort of talent on applying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am lack of applying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same time, I think the question really depends on individual&amp;rsquo;s experiences. Difficulty is a qualitative question rather than a quantitative one. Maybe I can try more practice and applying stuff such as do more projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advance forever. Happy applying!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to advance! Advance regardless any cost and consequences! No matter how difficult it is, no matter how painful the road is, we must move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as the goal is theoretically feasible, we have to push forward with all our strength and believe that it will be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Prior Probability of Life</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/prior-probability-of-life/</link>

        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/prior-probability-of-life/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of September. Looking back, this month has passed very quickly and I have learned a lot. The most important thing is to establish the White Room system, and thinking about the life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Bayesian theory, life should also consist of prior probability and posterior probability. Being alive and healthy constitutes the prior probability, while thoughts and actions constitute the posterior probability. When all conditions are met, it is the road to victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the coming month, I decided to finish my high school physics content and improve my English, everything will be checked on my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy October!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Time Slice, The beginning of everything</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/time-slice-the-beginning-of-everything/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/time-slice-the-beginning-of-everything/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Some thoughts on perfectionism and farsightedness&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts on perfectionism and farsightedness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in the peaceful years, no one will take risks anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that sometimes we must have a promise; so that you will not retreat, give up, or be at a loss at any time; let it be like a laser to clear the riddle and guide the direction; the past time can never be obtained, because history is pushed forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time rotates, but by the time you realize the rotation, it is too late. Fallen leaves return to their roots, but the evergreen trees in the south will not fall because of autumn. The imperfection of the world is the best gift for perfectionists; when you fall into reincarnation, it is the day when the promise is fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story, a story written from today; it will explain everything about me, where and why I do it: Make everything interesting, joyful and meaningful. Let memories become happy things, and let experience become the only evidence. When the goal is the extreme, you have to push everything higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a four-dimensional space, and I am a human living on a three-dimensional slice. Whether for civilization or individuals, only thinking from a higher dimension can solve those unimaginable or even unproposed problems - but they exist objectively, resulting in imperfection. This is time slicing. In the three-dimensional world, a cube can be easily unfolded into a flat white paper with one face, and vice versa; in the three-dimensional world, a Möbius strip can be easily created to splice two completely isolated two-dimensional worlds. In the four-dimensional world, everything in the three-dimensional world pales in comparison, so as long as the time dimension is controlled, all problems will be solved, and the originally difficult problems become easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is set to be one-way, redshift will not stop, and entropy increase will not end. Locking the flow of time greatly reduces the operating space, but it only locks the direction, so it can still be compensated to a certain extent by changing the flow rate and efficiency. This is time slicing, a new way of time management: It will truly describe this four-dimensional space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make memories an enjoyment, not a regret. Let time leave footprints, not cracks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/from-ksps/KSPS_on_Internet_Achieve.png" alt="Featured image of post From KSPS" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can never know when an accident will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I learned that the KSPS, which has been running for 3 years, was deleted not long ago and there is no backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-ksps&#34;&gt;The KSPS
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20240418034657/http://kerbal.freeflarum.com/&#34; style=&#34;float: right; width: 200px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;pbfymkz6.png&#34; alt=&#34;KSPS&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KSPS stands for &lt;code&gt;Kerbal Space Program Stack&lt;/code&gt;. Its original purpose was to better communicate KSP-related content, including but not limited to works, modules, and some other ideas. Through the support of beautification components, KSPS later became a resource sharing platform based on KSP, with chat room functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although KSPS is gone, BLOG will inherit everything from before, optimize, iterate and update continuously.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have decided to end the simultaneous update of Chinese and English content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest content and changes will only be published on the English page. I will consider synchronization if I have time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-i---11-dna--rna&#34;&gt;Part I - 1.1 DNA &amp;amp; RNA
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the genetic material that stores information&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Is responsible for all the variation in living things&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;found in nucleus of a cell&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Genetic variation is the differences between DNA of individuals within a population&lt;/strong&gt;
‎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nucleic Acids&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There biopolymers or small biomolecules essential to all known forms of life&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cells contain two types of Nucleic Acids:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;DNA - Deoxyribonucleic Acid&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;RNA - Ribonucleic Acid&lt;/strong&gt;
‎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nucleotides&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consist of a phosphate group, a sugar and a nitrogen base found in DNA &amp;amp; RNA&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;These smaller components make up the molecules of Nucleic Acids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nitrogenous base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sugar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA&amp;rsquo;s function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA stores genetic information&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Organisms inherit DNA from their biological parents&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This genetic information tells each cell what proteins to make and how to make them&lt;/strong&gt;
‎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contain instructions for making proteins, which are molecules made up of subunits called amino acids&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Various proteins control how a cell is formed and how it functions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The instruction provided by DNA are therefore responsible for the development of a organism&lt;/strong&gt;
‎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The complete DNA sequence in each cell of an organism&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Human genome consists of 3 billion base pairs&lt;/strong&gt;
‎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromosomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA usually exists in the form of chromatin. During cell division, the chromatin condenses into structures called chromosomes&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Human has 46 chromosomes and 23 pairs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23 chromosomes come from the biological father and 23 from the biological father and 23 from the biological mother&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22 of these are called Autosomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last pair is the sex chromosome&lt;/strong&gt;
‎&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex Chromosomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The X &amp;amp; Y chromosomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;X &amp;amp; Y - Genetic male&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;X &amp;amp; X - Genetic female&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The last pair of human chromosomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;DNA replication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enzymes cut nitrogenous bases, DNA split into 2 strands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each of the DNA stands act as a template for the formation of a complementary strand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The instructions for a protein are copied on to a RNA molecule which is then used to make the protein&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The end result is 2 DNA molecules that are identical to the original&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The passing of traits from parents to offspring&lt;/strong&gt;
Early Experiments, including growing and raising food crops and companion animals
‎
15. Gregor Mendel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the 1860&amp;rsquo;s he experimented with pea plants and discovered how traits can be passed from one generation to another&lt;/strong&gt;
‎
16. Self &lt;u&gt;pollination&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a male gamete within a flower combines with a female gamete in the same plant&lt;/strong&gt;
‎
17. Cross &lt;u&gt;pollination&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a male gamete of one plant combines with a female gametes of another&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;By deliberately cross pollinating plants he could control certain traits produced by the offspring&lt;/strong&gt;
‎
18. Mendel&amp;rsquo;s Experiments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purple and white flowered plants&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When they self pollinized they would produce offspring of the same color&lt;/strong&gt;
‎
19. Ture Breeding Plants&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plants that consistently produce offspring with only one form of trait&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each plant had two factors that act as a set of instructions for each trait&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each parent donates one of these factors to the offspring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One factor or trait may &lt;em&gt;dominate&lt;/em&gt; over the other if present&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Selective Advantages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic advantage of one organism over its competitors&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Over time, the selected advantage is a genetic advantage to be favored in terms of &lt;em&gt;survival and reproduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
‎
37. Natural Selection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best adapted members of a species survive and reproduce&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;They have favorable characteristics to give to their offspring&lt;/strong&gt;
‎
38. Adaptation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helps a organism survive and reproduce in a particular environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;The process of natural selection means that if there is such a that helps the population survive or produce, it will be inherited to the offspring survivors. As a result, over many generations, they will be more and more individuals with that inherited alliance. These individuals form a population better suitable to the environment.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;39&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speciation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During speciation, a new species is formed from existing population&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;As natural selection occurs, populations can diverge from each other to such a extent that they create a new species.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;They can no longer create fertile offspring&lt;/strong&gt;
‎
40. Geographical (varies)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes species can get cut off from one another graphically&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Over time, natural selection and other factors act on mutations in each population, producing new traits that are advantageous to individuals in their environment and are passed from one generation to the next
Given enough time, the populations will differ so much, and they become a new species
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;41&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adaptive Radiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the environment change, organisms can undergo adaptive radiation. This is when common &lt;em&gt;ancestors&lt;/em&gt; split into different species&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Island is a good example because it isolated the population and forces them to adapt to the environment.&lt;/strong&gt;
‎&lt;br&gt;
42. Extinction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extinction occurs when a species completely disappeares from the Earth&lt;/strong&gt;
Environmental influence create &lt;strong&gt;selective pressure&lt;/strong&gt; and these influence can either &lt;strong&gt;create a new species&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;existing new species may go extinct&lt;/strong&gt;
‎
43. Carcinogen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are mutagens that causes cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;e.x. - increase exposure to ultraviolet rays increase the chances of skin cancer, smoking can increase chains of lung cancer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Artificial Selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective pressure exerted by &lt;em&gt;humans&lt;/em&gt; on population in order to improve or modify desirable traits&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Also call this &lt;em&gt;artificial breeding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Most of food we eat grains, fruits, vegetables, meat and milk comes from a species we have selectively bred&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Artificial selections has caused cows to produce more milk, chicken have been bred to grow faster&lt;/strong&gt;
‎
45. Artificial Selection in food crops&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rice, corn, wheat and vegetables&lt;/em&gt; are a result of selective breedings&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Human started artificially breeding plants 4000 years ago in &lt;em&gt;Europe and Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We have created crops resistant to drought, disease resistant and pest resistant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving force - Environment change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving force - Human preferences and goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results - Have stronger ability to survive in natural environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results - Have more traits that human prefer, less genetic diversity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Similarities&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;changes in traits of populations over time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Biotechnology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the study of modifying DNA and making changes to the genes&lt;/strong&gt;
‎
53. Cloning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the process of produces identical copies of genes of DNA cells or organisms&lt;/strong&gt;
‎
54. Gene Cloning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Involves control DNA to produce multiple copies of genes or another segment of DNA in foreign cells&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Can be it used to make large amounts of proteins or to after an organism in a useful way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;process-of-gene-cloning&#34;&gt;Process of gene cloning
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extract DNA from interest cell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;em&gt;enzymes&lt;/em&gt; cut interest gene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insert gene into vector (plasmid), form recombinant DNA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transformation into host cell (bacteria)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replication, produce protein from cloned gene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;B-12.jpg&#34; &gt;B-12.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explain - chromosomal DNA, vector DNA, recombinant DNA, plasmid, bacteria cell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;55&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recombinant DNA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A DNA molecule that includes genetic material from different sources&lt;/strong&gt;
A period DNA from one is inserted into it
‎
56. Transgenic Organisms (Genetically Modified Organisms, GMO)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plants and animals that have DNA from other organisms inserted into them&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Increased nutrition content, made them &lt;em&gt;resistant to herbicides, pests and disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Use transgenic animals to make commercial and medical products for humans. Found treatments for diseases and produced drugs&lt;/strong&gt;
Pros - environmental contribution, socio-economic contribution
Cons - environmental threat, health effect, socio-economic issue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Transgenic milk-producing animals, such as goats, are being used to produce medical protein products that include human growth hormone and anti-clotting factors
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‎
57. DNA base technology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A person DNA profile can be used for police to compare DNA with a person of interest&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;DNA profiles can also be used to determine whether two people are biologically related&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;DNA can be used to identify viruses in food crops being exported or imported&lt;/strong&gt;
‎
58. Reproductive technologies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can be used for people with reproductive problems to give them a variety of options to conceive children&lt;/strong&gt;
‎
59. Artificial Insemination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is when a sperm is collected, concentrated and placed in a women&amp;rsquo;s uterus&lt;/strong&gt;
‎
60. In vitro Fertilization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In which a women eggs are directly fertilized by a male sperm in laboratory glassware. The embryos are then placed in thee women uterus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect sperm and egg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fertilization of egg in the lab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer to uterus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;61&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gene Therapy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctors insert a healthy functioning gene into target cells so that it can replace the mutated faulty gene responsible for carrying a genetic disorder&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;treat inherited diseases (such as inherited blindness)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find out defective gene&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivery of health gene using vectors (such as viruses)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patient get viruses, healthy genes goes into cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cells produce normal proteins
‎&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;62&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invasive Species - SHARB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is a species that has been intentionally or accidently introduced into a ecosystem where it did not previously exist&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Scientists try to detect the presence of invasive species as early as possible to protect and prevent them by testing their DNA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   e. x. They test insect eggs found in timber to see if its a invasive species
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-i---31-properties-of-energy&#34;&gt;Part I - 3.1 Properties of Energy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.      Energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ability to perform a task&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.      System&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An object and environment in which a energy change occurs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.      Surroundings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything in the universe that not a part of system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.      Kinetic energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The energy of object in motion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.      Potential energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stored energy has potential to be transformed into another form of energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.      3 Systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open system-Both energy and matter can be exchanged with surroundings&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Close system-Energy can be exchanged with surroundings, but matter can not&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Isolated system-Neither energy nor matter can be exchanged with surroundings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.      Kinetic molecular theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explain that particles are in constant motion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.      3 State of matter &amp;amp; KMT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solid, Liquid, Gas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9.      Mechanical kinetic energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The energy associated with objects moving&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10.    Radiant energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The energy transferred as electromagnetic waves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11.    Sound energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The energy transferred as a wave vibration moving through matter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12.    Electrical kinetic energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy of charge particles moving through a conductor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13.    Thermal energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy of moving particles transferred by heat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14.    Ways to measure thermal energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature-The measure of average kinetic energy of all the particles in a sample of matter&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Thermal energy-The total energy of all the particles in a solid, liquid or gas&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Heat-Amount of thermal energy that transferred from a high temperature area to a low temperature area&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15.    3 Unit of first one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelvin, Fahrenheit, Celsius&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16.    Heat transfer ways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conduction-Describe the transfer of heat occurs in faster moving particles collide with slower moving particles&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Convection-The transfer of heat occurs in liquid or gas. The particles contain heat and transfer it through moving, from one place to another&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Radiation-Transfer of heat by electromagnetic waves that carry radiation energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17.    Explain heating pot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water in the bottom of pot gain heat through conduction from stove, they absorb heat and expand, become less dense than surrounding water. As the result of it rising to the surface and cooling down, it contracts and sinks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18.    Mechanical Kinetic Energy Formula
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
E=\frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;-Kinetic energy&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;-Acceleration due to the gravitation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;-mass (kg)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;-Velocity (m/s)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19.    Explain following types of potential energy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical Potential Energy
&lt;strong&gt;Energy stored in chemical bonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elastic Potential Energy
&lt;strong&gt;Energy stored in belt, compressed and stretched objects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Energy stored in objects because of its position above a reference point&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear Energy
&lt;strong&gt;Energy stored in nucleus of an atom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric Potential Energy
&lt;strong&gt;Energy stored when charged particles separated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic Potential Energy
&lt;strong&gt;Energy stored when like pole of magnets forced together or unlike pole forced apart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20.    Gravitational Potential Energy Formula
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
Eg=mgΔh
$$&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eg&lt;/em&gt;-Gravitational Potential Energy&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;-Mass (kg)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;-Acceleration due to the gravitation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Δh&lt;/em&gt;-Change in height (m)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21.    Law of conservation of energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy can be transform, but can’t be created or destroyed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-ii---32-transforming-energy&#34;&gt;Part II - 3.2 Transforming Energy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;22.      Endothermic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breaking bonds&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The reactants has less chemical potential energy than products&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Some chemical reactions requires large amount of energy to break the bonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23.      Exothermic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forming bonds&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The reactants has more chemical potential energy than products&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Increase temperature of surroundings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24.      Photosynthesis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When carbon dioxide combine with light energy to form glucose and oxygen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
$$
6CO_{2}+6H_{2}O+Energy\to C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}+6O_{2}
$$&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Plants, some microscopic organisms &amp;amp; algae&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25.      Cellular Respiration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A series of chemical reactions where glucose reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}
+6O_{2}\to6CO_{2}+6H_{2}O+Energy$$&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Energy released as &lt;em&gt;mechanical kinetic energy&lt;/em&gt;(muscle contracting), &lt;em&gt;chemical potential energy&lt;/em&gt;(new molecules created), &lt;em&gt;Electrical potential energy&lt;/em&gt; (Sending signals to nerves cells)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26.      Fossil Fuels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fossil fuels contains large amount of energy that was made by ancient plants. Through extreme pressure and high temperature turning to coil, oil and natural gas&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
2C_{8}H_{18}+25O_{2}\to 16CO_{2}+18H_{2}O+energy
$$&lt;p&gt;27.      Fuel Cells&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical potential energy is transferred into electrical energy when it reacts with oxygen it turns into water&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
2H_{2}+O_{2}\to 2H_{2}O+Energy
$$&lt;p&gt;28.      Nuclear Reactions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Unstable isotopes of elements with a excess number of neutrons emit particles from their nuclei&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Unstable isotopes emit radiation as a high energy particles and electromagnetic waves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;29.      &lt;strong&gt;α&lt;/strong&gt; Alpha Decay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occurs when a &lt;em&gt;Alpha particle&lt;/em&gt; containing two neutrons and two protons  is emitted from the nucleus. The atomic mass decreases by 4 and the atomic number decreases by 2 resulting in the formation for a new element&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30.      &lt;strong&gt;β&lt;/strong&gt; Beta Decay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occurs when a neutron decays into a proton and a electron. And the electron is emitted from the nucleus as a &lt;em&gt;Beta particle&lt;/em&gt;. The proton remains in the nucleus and so the atomic number increase by one.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;No mass change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31.      &lt;strong&gt;γ&lt;/strong&gt; Gamma Decay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occurs when a nucleus that is in a excited state emits a high energy photon of electromagnetic energy. Energy called a &lt;em&gt;gamma ray&lt;/em&gt;.
Since a photon is electromagnetic energy, reactant atom didn&amp;rsquo;t change either mass and atomic number.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;32.      Nuclear Fusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occurs when two light atomic combine to form a heavy atomic. This reaction requires a vary large amount of energy to begin the reaction.
No nuclear waste is produced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;33.      Nuclear Fission&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occurs when a heavy atomic split into two light atomic.
Nuclear waste is produced during the reaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-iii---331-transforming-energy&#34;&gt;Part III - 3.31 Transforming Energy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;34.      Atmosphere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layers of gases that extend above a planets surface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;35.      Troposphere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layers nearest to the earth surface&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Contains all water vapor and dust&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;-55℃ at the top&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;99% N2 and O2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;36.      Stratosphere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ozone-Absorb ultraviolet radiation from sun&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;-55℃ at bottom, 0℃ at top&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;37.      Mesosphere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3rd layer
&lt;strong&gt;Temperature&amp;lt;-100℃&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bombarded with meteors and dust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;38.      Thermosphere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4th layer
&lt;strong&gt;1500℃~3000℃&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Charged particles colliding with the thermosphere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;39.      Exosphere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5th layer
&lt;strong&gt;Edge connected with universe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40.      Factors of Atmosphere Warm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insolation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;41.      Insolation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solar radiation transfers heat to the Earth. The amount of solar radiation that reaches the certain area is called insolation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;42.      Incidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angle between a ray reaching the earth surface and a line perpendicular to the surface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;43.      Radiation Budget&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance ingoing and outgoing energy. Incoming short wave solar radiation is reflected and absorbed to various degrees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;44.      Albedo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Describes the amount of radiation reflected by earth surface&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Low Albedo-Absorb more radiation&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;High Albedo-Reflect more radiation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;45.      Atmospheric Pressure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atmospheric pressure is a pressure exerted by mass of air above any point on the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;46.      Barometer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Used to measure atmospheric pressure in kilopascals (kpa)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The flexible metal capsule in the barometer expands and contracts as air pressure changes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;47.      Altitude and pressure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;48.      Temperature and pressure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warm air is less dens than cold air, resulting in lower atmospheric pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;49.      Humidity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurement describes the amount of water vapor in the air&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Greater humidity cause lower atmospheric pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;49.      Air mass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A mass of air with similar temperature and humidity throughout an area&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When cool air forms over a cool region a high pressure system forms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50.      Front&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A boundary between two air masses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;51.      Weather&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A condition of the atmosphere in a specific place and a specific time&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature, Atmospheric pressure, Humidity, Wind speed and direction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Closely connected to heat transfer in the atmosphere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;52.      Tornado&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Violent funnel-shaped column
High-altitude meets large thunderstorm
When &lt;em&gt;warm, moist air&lt;/em&gt; rises into the atmosphere, &lt;em&gt;rain&lt;/em&gt; is produced and &lt;em&gt;heat energy&lt;/em&gt; is released
Warm air rushes into the atmosphere, displacing cool air, creating the Coriolis effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;53.      Wind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movement of air from high pressure area to low pressure area.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Geographic features such as &lt;em&gt;mountains&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;oceans&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;lakes&lt;/em&gt; greatly affect the characteristics of local winds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;54.      Prevailing Winds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical winds for a certain region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;55.      Coriolis Effect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change in direction of moving air, water or objects due to the earths rotation
Coriolis effect and convection results in three major global wind systems
&lt;em&gt;Trade winds, Prevailing Westerlies, Polar Easterlies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-iv---332-natural-causes-of-climate-change&#34;&gt;Part IV - 3.32 Natural Causes of Climate Change
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;56.      Climate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Describes the average conditions of the atmosphere in a region over 30 years or more&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Includes &lt;em&gt;Clouds, Precipitation, Average Temperature, Humidity, Atmospheric Pressure, Solar Radiation, and Winds&lt;/em&gt;
Climate can refer to a region as small as an island or as large as a planet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;57.      Biogeoclimatic Zones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A region with a certain type of plant life, soil geography and climate&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 zones in BC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;58.      Climate Change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Natural causes-&lt;em&gt;Greenhouse Gases, Volcanic Eruptions, Earth&amp;rsquo;s Orbital Changes, Earth&amp;rsquo;s tilt Changes, Ocean Currents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Human causes-&lt;em&gt;Burning of Fossil Fuels, Agriculture, Use of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effect &lt;em&gt;redistribution&lt;/em&gt; of thermal energy around the world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;59.      Paleoclimatologist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study fossils and sediments or gather information about glaciers to help them understand climate change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;60.      Ice cores&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samples taken help us determine what types and amount of gases existed in the atmosphere when the ice was formed&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;By reviewing &lt;em&gt;CO2&lt;/em&gt; data scientists can estimate the climate for the last 650,000 years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;60.      Affect Climate Change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenhouse Gases-In the atmosphere absorb and emit solar radiation as thermal energy, increasing Earth&amp;rsquo;s temperature&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
↑Greenhouse{ }Gases↑Temperature
$$&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Earth tilt, axis of rotation and orbit around the Sun-Earth experiences seasonal changes due to a combination of its tilt and orbit. When the Earth&amp;rsquo;s rotation angle is between 22.1 and 24.5, the Earth&amp;rsquo;s tilt is greatest, changing the angle of the incidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;61.      Carbon Cycle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The carbon cycle maintains the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is an important greenhouse gas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;62.      Carbon Sinks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep ocean shelled organism, forest, removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Carbon is converted to &lt;em&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/em&gt; in shells of many shelled organisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;63.      Carbon Sources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weathering&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;decaying vegetation&lt;/em&gt; add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;64.      Catastrophic Events&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large disasters such as &lt;em&gt;volcanic eruptions&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;meteorite impacts&lt;/em&gt; can send &lt;em&gt;dust, debris and gases&lt;/em&gt; into the atmosphere, which reflect and absorb solar radiation, causing the Earth to cool.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;65.      Water Cycle (C.P.E.T)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circulation of water on, above and under the earth surface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Condensation&lt;/em&gt;-As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it gains gravitational potential energy. It also releases thermal energy to air molecules through collisions. It then cools, condenses around particles in the atmosphere and form clouds. The condensation process more thermal energy to the atmosphere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precipitation&lt;/em&gt;- The water returns to Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface through precipitation when it rains or snows, as the precipitation falls, its gravitational potential energy is transformed into mechanical kinetic energy. This transformation continues as water flows from higher to lower level on the land. Thermal energy is also transferred to the atmosphere through friction as precipitation falls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evaporation&lt;/em&gt;- When water absorbs the sun&amp;rsquo;s energy, the molecules begin to move faster as the solar energy is transformed into thermal energy. If enough solar energy is transformed, water evaporates from Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface. It enters the atmosphere as water vapor, bringing the thermal energy with it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transpiration&lt;/em&gt;- In transpiration plants take up water from ground or bodies of water. In the case of aquatic plants and release into the atmosphere as water vapor like evaporation, transpiration moves thermal energy into the atmosphere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High temperature Increase the evaporation of water and capacity of air to hold water vapor.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
↑Temperature↑Watervapor↑HoldAbility
$$&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Captures more thermal energy, causing the temperature to rise further&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;66.      Ocean Currents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sinking and rising of deep ocean water creates convection currents that act as a global conveyor belt, transporting water and thermal energy around the Earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;67.      El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;El Niño-Weaken trade winds, warm water move eastward. Canada &amp;amp; northern U.S. &lt;em&gt;warmer and dryer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;La Niña-Stronger trade wind, warm water pushed back to Asia, cool water rises. Canada &amp;amp; northern U.S. &lt;em&gt;cooler and more precipitation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-v---333-human-activity-and-climate-change&#34;&gt;Part V - 3.33 Human Activity and Climate Change
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;68.      Global Warming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global average temperature increase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;69.      Enhanced Greenhouse Effect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased capacity of the atmosphere to absorb and emit thermal energy because of increase in greenhouse gases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;69.      Global Warming Potential (GWP)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-vi---334-energy-transformation--global-systems&#34;&gt;Part VI - 3.34 Energy Transformation &amp;amp; Global Systems
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;74.      Earth Energy System&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three main types of energy are responsible for Earths System.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solar Energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Created by Sun&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gravitational Potential Energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Created by earth&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuclear Energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Found in nucleus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;75.      Solar Energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solar energy drives the water cycle and sustains life on the Earth by providing energy for photosynthesis&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Solar energy made up by electromagnetic radiation of &lt;em&gt;different wavelengths&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;	&lt;strong&gt;These waves transformed into &lt;em&gt;thermal energy&lt;/em&gt; when they interact with matter.&lt;/strong&gt;	&lt;strong&gt;About &lt;em&gt;half&lt;/em&gt; of this energy enters the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, while visible light tends to pass through the atmosphere and reach the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface unchanged.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When it reaches the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface, it is converted into &lt;em&gt;thermal energy&lt;/em&gt;. It is then radiated into the surroundings in the form of &lt;em&gt;Infrared radiation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;It temporarily transfers part of the energy and heat, which plays an important role in the warming of the atmosphere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;76.      Conduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After land and water absorb solar energy, the molecules collide more frequently with air molecules close to the surface.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This collisions transfer thermal energy as a result of temperature of the lower air comes close to the land temperature This &lt;em&gt;triggers convection&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;77.      Convection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convection occurs as the lower layer of the air warms from conduction&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
AirWarms\to Expands\to BecomeLessDense
$$&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Less dense air rises and cooler, more dense air sinks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;78.      Infrared Radiation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play the largest role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;It helps warm the atmosphere, preventing the Earth from becoming overheated and radiating energy out of the atmosphere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;79.      Water Cycle &amp;amp; Cooling Effect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water Cycle moderation of &lt;em&gt;earth surface temperature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;water absorbs a lot of energy when it evaporates. This causes &lt;em&gt;cooling effect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;80.      Specific Heat Capacity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The amount of energy needed to change the temperature of 1g of a substance 1℃&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Earth&amp;rsquo;s vast ocean can store a vast amount of thermal energy with very little change in temperature. Ocean transfer and radiate energy to their colder surroundings. This happened slowly.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Without this effect, the Earth would experience &lt;em&gt;radical shifts&lt;/em&gt; in temperature between day and night. It would also be much &lt;em&gt;hotter in the summer&lt;/em&gt; and much &lt;em&gt;colder in the winter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Starfield?</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/starfield/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/starfield/</guid>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are other civilizations in the universe that are more developed than humans, I think their world must be extremely neat and tidy cities, with sharp buildings, obvious artificial features in landform transformation and various functional areas, and the operation of the city depends on powerful central supercomputer control. Aliens may look special, but they will have a lot of auxiliary equipment on their bodies, their thoughts will be more mature than humans, their logical ability will be stronger, and their emotions will fluctuate less, which is equivalent to the artificial intelligence life form in the human science fiction world. Perhaps these aliens are the silicon-based civilization heritage left behind after the disappearance of the carbon-based civilization of the planet, making these intelligent machines created to serve carbon-based creatures the new heirs of civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why alien civilizations can continue to develop must be that they are a race with less internal friction, high teamwork ability, and diverse means of observing the world. Less internal friction means that their civilization will not collapse due to resource competition, teamwork ability means high production efficiency, and diverse means of observing the world means a deeper understanding of the physical rules of the universe, so this is the reason why alien civilizations are more developed than the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien civilizations are definitely not absurd and weird cities, chaotic buildings, and backward and barbaric ideas. Such a population cannot be at the forefront of developed civilizations, but will consume each other in the competition for resources and go to destruction. Savage thoughts also mean increasing the risk of internal friction, becoming the fuse of civilization destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more advanced civilizations may be related to their special environment, with abundant sunshine, vast territory, rich mineral resources, and special metal materials, which means that their energy acquisition methods are easier and more abundant. It is possible that aliens can absorb and store energy themselves, and may convert energy in an efficient way to achieve almost no loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dare not imagine how fierce it will be in Star Wars when each civilization uses the biggest killer of their planet to launch it on the battlefield, and various aliens divide the work and cooperate in production, defense, confrontation, and plunder. They use various battleship tactics and technology to fight for space resources, and they will also form alliances with neighboring galaxy civilizations to develop resources. It is more likely to form a situation of confrontation between multiple forces, and the battlefield is full of star-shaped battleship wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is just a restatement of science fiction movies and novels, it is quite interesting :D&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/obsidian-is-not-enough/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This can be said to be the worst month. Although DSα was good at first, the complexity of the table and the tediousness of the calculations made me spend too much time on this &amp;ldquo;efficiency system&amp;rdquo;, wasting a lot of time without any actual results. The program that automatically calculates time has no practical effect, and I have not found a suitable way to summarize and process the large amount of data generated every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding DSα on Obsidian has indeed simplified a lot of content, but it still cannot solve the fundamental problem, that is, it is not intuitive enough. The limitations of the table and the disappointing functions of Obsidian mind mapping software forced me to choose other software to build this system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am migrating it to Simplemind Pro, a well-rated mind mapping software. The completely free configuration and nodes can free the original content from the table, because the best choice is &amp;ldquo;display everything on a huge plane&amp;rdquo;, what you see is what you get.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Brand New - Time Flip</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/brand-new-time-flip/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Directivity system α has been finalized and archived. Timeflip will remake and update all previous content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directivity system α is the first attempt to manage time based on the latest theoretical results, and has gained a lot of data and experience. Timeflip is a reset and updated version of D.s. α to solve many of its problems, expand the management scope, and greatly optimize the tediousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theoretical-basis&#34;&gt;Theoretical basis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timeflp will continue the characteristics of D.s. α, systematize the results, and use Result list to replace Todo list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike D.s. α, goal setting will not be excluded, and Timeline will be used to solve intuitive problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Directivity System α</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is necessary to do something new in the new year. The efficiency research in 2023 has not even made any progress on paper, and the low efficiency is amazing&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to combine the methods of summarizing and experimenting in 2022 and 2023 and the latest theoretical results into a system that can promote efficiency improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Directivity system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be built on Obsidian and combined with a complete knowledge base to form an effective workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual plan for 2024 is created based on [[Directivity system α]] and will be committed to providing goal orientation for the whole year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;directivity-system-α&#34;&gt;Directivity System α
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-lasting plan&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Long-lasting plan&lt;/strong&gt; is the overall plan, which is a long-term ideal plan and overall goal. &lt;strong&gt;Long-lasting plan&lt;/strong&gt; plans take a certain amount of time to complete because of their long time span.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annual plan&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Annual plan&lt;/strong&gt; will provide an index for each year&amp;rsquo;s goals and judge the work status of the whole year based on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly plan/Weekly plan&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Monthly plan&lt;/strong&gt; will refine the annual goal arrangement to get monthly and weekly goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day results&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Day results&lt;/strong&gt; As the most basic unit, it no longer uses the planning method, but directly counts the results, which is conducive to the visualization of the results and goal progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-new&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s NEW
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual plan for 2024 systematizes goals, plans, and results for the first time, making them measurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual plan for 2024 will replace Todo list with &lt;strong&gt;Result list&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Result list&lt;/strong&gt; is the result of &amp;ldquo;committed to production&amp;rdquo;, while most Todo lists usually exist separately from the commitment to produce results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual plan for 2024 is also the first practice of Directivity system α. This will help you notice the most important results. Then focus on the upcoming time frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main&#34;&gt;Main
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;theoretical-basis&#34;&gt;Theoretical basis:
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extremely Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; : After a year of research on work efficiency, Paramount efficiency theory has been proven to be the key to efficient work completion. In 2024, &lt;strong&gt;Extremely Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; will inherit this and use it as a basis for rapid iteration and practice of various theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endorphins and long-termism&lt;/strong&gt;: Increase endorphins and reduce dopamine through &lt;strong&gt;long-termism&lt;/strong&gt; and sustainable actions. Physical and mental health is the basis for achieving goals, and long-term persistence in action and maintaining high efficiency can lead to better results and endorphin income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result oriented&lt;/strong&gt;: One of the biggest changes in 2024 is to change from plan-oriented to result-oriented. Results are evaluated directly by goals, rather than by whether the plan is completed. Result orientation pays more attention to the direct connection between the completed content and the goal, so as to know where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid iteration and experimentalism&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Rapid iteration&lt;/strong&gt; can quickly improve the unreasonable aspects of theory or practice, and quickly improve through continuous trial and error to achieve the final results. &lt;strong&gt;experimentalism&lt;/strong&gt; is the biggest helper when facing unknown theories or events. Many theories are not universal, so it is necessary to build methods and systems that belong only to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First principles&lt;/strong&gt; : First principles thinking helps to find the root of the problem and avoid useless work and superficial solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feynman&lt;/strong&gt; : The Feynman learning method aims to repeat facts and principle knowledge to discover and determine whether the content has been mastered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Boxing&lt;/strong&gt; : The &lt;strong&gt;Time Boxing&lt;/strong&gt; working method aims to divide time into small enough bars for allocation and planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
