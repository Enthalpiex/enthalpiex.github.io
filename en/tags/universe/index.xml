        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/time-travel-in-mwi/TVL.png" alt="Featured image of post Time Travel in MWI" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In classical conceptions of time travel, particularly within a single-timeline universe, the grandfather paradox poses a serious logical problem: if a person travels back in time and prevents their grandfather from having children, how could the time traveler have been born to commit the act in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that the grandfather paradox assumes two premises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We live in a shared reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reality of the past and the future is the same, and all events are caused by cause and effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, these two assumptions are not correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;time-travel-under-mwi&#34;&gt;Time Travel Under MWI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)&lt;/strong&gt; of quantum mechanics offers a fundamentally different framework that avoids such paradoxes altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MWI posits that every quantum event with multiple possible outcomes causes the universe to split into multiple, non-interacting branches, each representing a different outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional MWI theory holds that the universe does not have a single timeline, but an infinite &amp;ldquo;tree&amp;rdquo; composed of divergent world lines. In fact, it is more likely that all the divergent world lines themselves have always existed and formed a &amp;ldquo;grid&amp;rdquo; in which consciousness constantly shuttles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If time travel is possible in such a framework, then the traveler is not moving backwards along a single timeline. We know that the traveler is actually constantly traveling between worldlines, so their arrival in the &amp;ldquo;past&amp;rdquo; will result in the creation or intersection of a new worldline, a parallel branch that diverges from the point of arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this branching structure, meeting a version of your past self is plausible. However, the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; that exists in that past is not the exact same entity that became the future traveler. Rather, it is a copy on a parallel worldline. The moment you travel back, you create or join a branch where both versions of you co-exist, and their timelines may continue independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we also know that shadow people do not have a dominant consciousness, which means you will meet your shadow people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-the-grandfather-paradox-doesnt-occur&#34;&gt;Why the Grandfather Paradox Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Occur
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this branching, any actions taken in the &amp;ldquo;past&amp;rdquo; do not overwrite the traveler&amp;rsquo;s origin timeline. If you were to stop your grandfather from having children in that new branch, it would not affect the original branch from which you came. Instead, it would only change the course of history in that particular parallel world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, causality is preserved within each branch, and no contradictions arise. The original sequence of events that led to your birth remains intact in your original worldline, even if you prevent it in another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, your shadow copy has no logical connection with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our MWI framework, there is only one dominant consciousness, so even if the dominant consciousness returns to the world lines it has been to, it will only encounter its own &amp;ldquo;shadow man&amp;rdquo;. This will not cause the dominant consciousness to suddenly visit itself in its memory, because the dominant consciousness returns to that world line after it has experienced that world line. The dominant consciousness&amp;rsquo;s memory will not change because it does not have the experience of the &amp;ldquo;shadow man&amp;rdquo; on the world line it returned to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in theory, there is nothing wrong with killing your grandfather. Furthermore, if your grandfather has passed away, then you have not actually killed anyone, because at this time all &amp;ldquo;grandfathers&amp;rdquo; are just empty shells, and the dominant consciousness has left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MWI, time travel is as easy as moving around in the three-dimensional world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shadow People in MWI</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP04.png" alt="Featured image of post Shadow People in MWI" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;occupancy&#34;&gt;Occupancy
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on what was discussed previously, 99.99999% of world-lines are empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that most of the world lines that consciousness experiences are simply filled with other people, animals, and things that have no consciousness. These people and animals are called &amp;ldquo;shadows&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;shadow people&amp;rdquo; because while they appear to move and think, they have no consciousness. They are projections of consciousness, and their main consciousness is somewhere else. They are the &amp;ldquo;what ifs&amp;rdquo; of the action and the landscape that your consciousness interacts with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visualize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP01.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1481&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;391px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is a simplification. In reality, all the “shadow people” possess a consciousness. This explains why the thoughts of those around you affect your MWI navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some small percentage of a consciousness within every shadow entity. It’s just that the percentage is very tiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the infinite lines of the world has consciousness running through it. Not just other people&amp;rsquo;s, but yours as well. It&amp;rsquo;s an almost insignificant amount. Your consciousness dominates all other consciousnesses in the world line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP02.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;some-explanations&#34;&gt;Some explanations
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In quantum physics, when two quanta meet, they become entangled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the realm outside of our reality; the one that contains all the near-infinite numbers of world-lines, there isn’t any time or space. It’s a region with no geometry. So everything can entangle in a quantum sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means there is no world-lines are independent. They are all connected to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is actually happening is that clusters of world-lines entangle with other clusters of world-lines. They do this when ever a consciousness is injected into a world-line template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all of this entanglement puts a little infinitesimal part of you, and those around you near you in what ever world-line that your consciousness happens to occupy at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are other factors at play. Injecting consciousness into a template does not mean that the entire infinite number of world lines are entangled. The effect will &amp;ldquo;fade out,&amp;rdquo; or diminish as the variance increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will resemble something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP03.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1380&#34;
	height=&#34;844&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP03_hu_652491b6f3f9b5d1.png 480w, https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP03_hu_4c0adba31f17793.png 1024w&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;392px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability of a consciousness to entangle with “close proximity” world-lines happens automatically. However, the ability for the entangled world-lines to entangle with other world-lines drops off as the degree of variance increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider that this is happening for the billions upon billions of people that are entering and leaving our template surface. Each one is “making their marks”. All combine to provide some “foot print” of their present upon the template that you inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;paradox&#34;&gt;Paradox
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that everyone was 100% fully conscious in their bodies, and that the mind controlled our reality, our reality would probably become a very confusing, ever-changing mess of reality. Reality will also change as quickly and irrationally as dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP04.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1381&#34;
	height=&#34;862&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP04_hu_e638f18b6f141321.png 480w, https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP04_hu_ae5ad15e10589696.png 1024w&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;160&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;384px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person&amp;rsquo;s consciousness is the dominant consciousness in the world line he lives in, it means that his thoughts are also the dominant thoughts in the world line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By controlling and directing thoughts, we can not only control our navigation, but our influence in the strong quantum entanglements of “near-by” (but untraveled) world-lines means that we have the potential to influence the trends and behaviors of the environment around us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is MWI</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-is-mwi/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-is-mwi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-is-mwi/0008.png" alt="Featured image of post What is MWI" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction-to-the-many-worlds-interpretation-mwi&#34;&gt;Introduction to the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics emerged in the early 20th century to explain strange behaviors at the atomic and subatomic levels—such as electrons existing in multiple states at once or particles behaving like both waves and particles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematically, quantum systems are described by a wavefunction (Ψ), which evolves deterministically over time according to the Schrödinger equation. This wavefunction contains all possible outcomes of a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;copenhagen-interpretation-vs-mwi&#34;&gt;Copenhagen Interpretation vs. MWI
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the experiment we can know that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before measurement, particles exist in a &lt;strong&gt;superposition&lt;/strong&gt; of all possible states.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After measurement, we observe &lt;strong&gt;one definite outcome&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where do the results come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Copenhagen Interpretation, developed primarily by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in the 1920s, was the first and most widely accepted explanation of this puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wavefunction represents &lt;strong&gt;our knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; of a system, not objective reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a measurement is made, the wavefunction &lt;strong&gt;collapses&lt;/strong&gt; into a single outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior to observation, physical properties are &lt;strong&gt;undefined&lt;/strong&gt; or &amp;ldquo;potential.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is clear that the Copenhagen interpretation suffers from a great deal of ambiguity: it has no clear way of defining “observation” or the observer, nor does it explain what actually exists before the observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1957, physicist Hugh Everett III proposed the Many-Worlds Interpretation as a clean, deterministic alternative to Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this theory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wavefunction &lt;strong&gt;never collapses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All possible outcomes of quantum events &lt;strong&gt;actually happen&lt;/strong&gt;—in &lt;strong&gt;separate branches&lt;/strong&gt; of the universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measurement causes &lt;strong&gt;decoherence&lt;/strong&gt;, not collapse: the world &amp;ldquo;splits&amp;rdquo; into multiple, non-interacting outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A particle in superposition doesn’t choose one outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, the universe &lt;strong&gt;branches&lt;/strong&gt;, and each outcome occurs in its own “world.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further reasoning, any &amp;ldquo;forking&amp;rdquo; behavior may not exist, but the world line corresponding to each result itself always exists, and the observer moves between these worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;schrödingers-cat&#34;&gt;Schrödinger&amp;rsquo;s Cat
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erwin Schrödinger proposed his famous thought experiment in 1935:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine a cat sealed in a box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside, there is a radioactive atom with a 50% chance to decay in one hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it decays, a Geiger counter triggers a hammer that breaks a vial of poison, killing the cat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it doesn’t decay, the cat lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Copenhagen interpretation, the system remains in superposition (cat is dead and alive) until a measurement is made. At the moment of observation, the wavefunction collapses into one of the two possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You see a &lt;strong&gt;live cat&lt;/strong&gt;, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You see a &lt;strong&gt;dead cat&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one outcome becomes real, and the other disappears. The act of observation causes reality to “choose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MWI gives a different answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cat is both dead and alive, but in different worlds.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In one &lt;strong&gt;branch&lt;/strong&gt; of the universe, the atom decays → poison is released → the cat dies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In another &lt;strong&gt;branch&lt;/strong&gt;, the atom does not decay → the poison is not released → the cat lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two outcomes both happen, in separate branches of reality. There is no collapse but decoherence, which prevents the branches from interfering with each other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you open the box, &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; also become part of the superposition:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One version of you sees a &lt;strong&gt;dead cat&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another version sees a &lt;strong&gt;live cat&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; perspective as the observer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will experience &lt;strong&gt;only one outcome&lt;/strong&gt; (say, the live cat).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;another version of you&lt;/strong&gt;, equally real, experiences the &lt;strong&gt;other&lt;/strong&gt; outcome (dead cat).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You and your alternate self now live in &lt;strong&gt;separate, non-interacting worlds&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the above content, we can find that if MWI exists, the world will be &amp;ldquo;split&amp;rdquo; all the time, and the observer will move all the time, from one world to another. For the sake of distinction, the &amp;ldquo;world&amp;rdquo; will be called &amp;ldquo;world line&amp;rdquo; to more accurately describe the history and future of each world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mwi-and-reality&#34;&gt;MWI and Reality
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MWI is a large universe of possibilities. And each possibility is a frozen moment that our consciousness briefly visits. On top of this, our consciousness is constantly moving in and out of different realities. Since each reality is its own unique worldline, we can say that we are moving in and out of different worldlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When consciousness enters an individual&amp;rsquo;s reality, this life begins a relatively fixed journey of life. Although we feel that we have free will and can choose our direction and thoughts, there are actually many invisible restrictions around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when a baby first comes into this world, it cannot walk, talk, or even crawl, and can only lie in the crib. In theory, it may try to crawl to the edge of the bed and try to crawl out, but that is extremely limited &amp;ldquo;freedom&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;start&#34;&gt;Start
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could assume that consciousness &amp;ldquo;activates&amp;rdquo; at some point early in life. For some people, this may happen in the womb; for others, it may be after birth. For most people, consciousness is unstable at first, and it may enter and leave the body from time to time until it finally stabilizes and truly integrates into this reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we draw this process on a world line diagram, it is &amp;ldquo;falling into&amp;rdquo; the world line template map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-is-mwi/0001.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-first-few-minutes&#34;&gt;The first few minutes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first few minutes, days, and months, freedom of movement is very limited. The consciousness is still learning how to move, learning how to use the body. So the actual physical activity it can do is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if it pushed itself, and it strove to overcome, it could roll, crawl, move and do other things that are very difficult to do. These difficult things can be defined as hills and mountains on the template map. Using the Z-axis, the higher the “mountain”, the harder the effort. The shallower the depression, the easier the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-is-mwi/0002.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, consciousness moves on this template map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the personality of consciousness, it either chooses the easy route or it becomes a &amp;ldquo;tough guy&amp;rdquo; and pushes forward, striving to &amp;ldquo;climb those mountains.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can conclude that before birth, everyone corresponds to a preset &amp;ldquo;world line template&amp;rdquo;. This template largely determines the direction of your future development. Therefore, if you do nothing and live your life naturally, your future will be roughly predictable without much deviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if you decide to climb “those hills and mountains”, what then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The height of the &amp;ldquo;mountain&amp;rdquo; is a measure of effort and deviation from the comfortable norm of the consciousness&amp;rsquo;s pre-birth worldline template. When consciousness leaves the &amp;ldquo;flat, safe&amp;rdquo; median, it will change, but the change will not be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, the pre-birth worldline template will still remain pretty much the same. The consciousness will &amp;ldquo;climb that mountain&amp;rdquo; and then discover other areas that were originally forbidden to it, i.e., possibilities that were originally unreachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the above inferences, it can be concluded that the location of entry into the template is very critical, which will determine how much effort the consciousness needs to put in to reach where they want to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;glossary&#34;&gt;Glossary
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;time&#34;&gt;Time
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the MWI, consciousness is constantly moving between worldlines, so what we call &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo; is actually the experience and process of consciousness moving through the MWI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, each consciousness experiences their own version of &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo;, which is determined by the speed at which the consciousness travels between worldlines. A &amp;ldquo;unified&amp;rdquo; time exists within a single worldline, but this is of no help to consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;life-line&#34;&gt;Life-Line
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A “life-line” is a collection of experiences that a consciousness has. As the consciousness moves in and out of individual moments of time, it creates a path. This path looks like a vector. It starts at the moment of birth and ends at the moment of death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A timeline is a segment of a lifeline. It can be a continuous segment of any lifeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;world-line&#34;&gt;World-Line
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &amp;ldquo;world line&amp;rdquo; is a frozen moment, like a photograph. It contains its unique history and future. The history and future of each world line are different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as using the world-line map template, each intersection point, dot or globe represents one such world-line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;world-line-cluster&#34;&gt;World-Line Cluster
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the number of consciousnesses is finite, but the number of worldlines is close to infinite, then the probability that each consciousness has its own worldline is greatest. In other words, shared worldlines are rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as the consciousness travels on the MWI it does so based upon it’s thoughts. If others share the same thoughts, they travel the MWI in a similar manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you map out the Time-Lines of people who are sharing similar thoughts, you will find that they seem to travel together, and they seem to experience the same World-lines. Which known as clustering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;echo-chamber&#34;&gt;Echo Chamber
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In discussions of news media, an echo chamber refers to situations in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system and insulated from rebuttal. By participating in an echo chamber, people are able to seek out information that reinforces their existing views without encountering opposing views, potentially resulting in an unintended exercise in confirmation bias. Echo chambers may increase social and political polarization and extremism.
-Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you only listen to a certain type of &amp;ldquo;news&amp;rdquo; and only receive opinions from others who agree with you, your thoughts will be reinforced into a set narrative and you will not be able to think other thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of MWI, it is dangerous to be in a closed environment where thoughts are set to &amp;ldquo;be in a rut&amp;rdquo;. It locks you into a path and drives you to a set place in MWI, whether good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;template-map&#34;&gt;Template Map
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The template map is a model used to visualize how consciousness moves in MWI. It can be thought of as a topological map, made up of grid intersections, each of which represents a &amp;ldquo;world line&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shape of the map surface reflects the most likely path a consciousness can move through its physical body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The height of the terrain represents the difficulty of movement. Flat areas symbolize easy movement without much effort, while &amp;ldquo;mountains&amp;rdquo; represent extremely high difficulties and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;pre-birth-world-line-template-map&#34;&gt;Pre-Birth World-Line Template Map
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refers to the first map that is set when a baby is born and the consciousness is injected into the body. This map is designed before the consciousness enters the material world, and its purpose is to allow the consciousness to experience a specific series of experiences in it. This is a carefully constructed specific life path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this map, the consciousness will travel along the most convenient path pre-set to experience a series of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to leave this map is to &amp;ldquo;slide&amp;rdquo; into another completely different template map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;slide&#34;&gt;Slide
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slide is an intentional change of the template map. Consciousness “slide” off the map that you are on, and land on a completely different map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this can be accomplished through design, the most effective way (on an individual basis) is to do it through thinking. By specifically controlling your thoughts to slide out of the template map, sliding to the template that is next to it, like sliding from one layer of a layer cake to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;shadow-people&#34;&gt;Shadow People
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consciousness travels through world lines alone. It is extremely rare for another consciousness to share a world line with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for a consciousness, all these &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo; it sees are actually just an empty container. They are real, and they have feelings that we react to, but its consciousness is not there, but on their own world line. This person on all other world lines is just a projection of the main consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;mountains&#34;&gt;Mountains
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the topography of a world-line template are “highs” and “lows”. These features define the difficulty of effort to move in those directions. A “mountain” is a particularly difficult are to traverse. And on the 3D map it will appear as a mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;hills&#34;&gt;Hills
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hill is similar to a mountain. It’s level of difficulty to traverse is proportionally smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;comfort-zone&#34;&gt;Comfort Zone
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In actual experience, the flat, unruffled areas on the world line template map are the so-called &amp;ldquo;comfort zones&amp;rdquo;. No matter how rugged and steep the terrain ahead looks, there will always be a relatively smooth and easy path in the world line template set before birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing is that no matter what you face in life, there is always a &amp;ldquo;default route&amp;rdquo; waiting for you to move forward; it may be smooth or difficult, but it always exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This document aims to systematically organize and summarize the core concepts related to the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) to help build a more complete understanding of the nature of reality. To facilitate thinking and communication, several simplified models and analogies are used in this document. These expressions strive to be close to reality, but they do not represent the only or final explanation. Please note: reality is far more complex than the model, and you should avoid construction as much as possible when reading this document.&lt;/p&gt;
