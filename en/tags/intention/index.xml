        <title>Shadow People in MWI</title>

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on what was discussed previously, 99.99999% of world-lines are empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that most of the world lines that consciousness experiences are simply filled with other people, animals, and things that have no consciousness. These people and animals are called &amp;ldquo;shadows&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;shadow people&amp;rdquo; because while they appear to move and think, they have no consciousness. They are projections of consciousness, and their main consciousness is somewhere else. They are the &amp;ldquo;what ifs&amp;rdquo; of the action and the landscape that your consciousness interacts with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visualize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP01.png&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;391px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is a simplification. In reality, all the “shadow people” possess a consciousness. This explains why the thoughts of those around you affect your MWI navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some small percentage of a consciousness within every shadow entity. It’s just that the percentage is very tiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the infinite lines of the world has consciousness running through it. Not just other people&amp;rsquo;s, but yours as well. It&amp;rsquo;s an almost insignificant amount. Your consciousness dominates all other consciousnesses in the world line.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;some-explanations&#34;&gt;Some explanations
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In quantum physics, when two quanta meet, they become entangled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the realm outside of our reality; the one that contains all the near-infinite numbers of world-lines, there isn’t any time or space. It’s a region with no geometry. So everything can entangle in a quantum sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means there is no world-lines are independent. They are all connected to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is actually happening is that clusters of world-lines entangle with other clusters of world-lines. They do this when ever a consciousness is injected into a world-line template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all of this entanglement puts a little infinitesimal part of you, and those around you near you in what ever world-line that your consciousness happens to occupy at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are other factors at play. Injecting consciousness into a template does not mean that the entire infinite number of world lines are entangled. The effect will &amp;ldquo;fade out,&amp;rdquo; or diminish as the variance increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will resemble something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP03.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1380&#34;
	height=&#34;844&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP03_hu_652491b6f3f9b5d1.png 480w, https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP03_hu_4c0adba31f17793.png 1024w&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;392px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability of a consciousness to entangle with “close proximity” world-lines happens automatically. However, the ability for the entangled world-lines to entangle with other world-lines drops off as the degree of variance increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider that this is happening for the billions upon billions of people that are entering and leaving our template surface. Each one is “making their marks”. All combine to provide some “foot print” of their present upon the template that you inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;paradox&#34;&gt;Paradox
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that everyone was 100% fully conscious in their bodies, and that the mind controlled our reality, our reality would probably become a very confusing, ever-changing mess of reality. Reality will also change as quickly and irrationally as dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP04.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1381&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;160&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;384px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person&amp;rsquo;s consciousness is the dominant consciousness in the world line he lives in, it means that his thoughts are also the dominant thoughts in the world line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By controlling and directing thoughts, we can not only control our navigation, but our influence in the strong quantum entanglements of “near-by” (but untraveled) world-lines means that we have the potential to influence the trends and behaviors of the environment around us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>False Positives in MWI Navigation</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/false-positives-in-mwi-navigation/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/false-positives-in-mwi-navigation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that can be pretty common in an intention campaign is the presence of “false positives”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False positives are events or things that appear to match your verbal affirmations in substance, but have some glaring defect that makes them unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like ripples in a pond, a target object or situation can often create “ghost” or “echo” images. These items are not necessarily exactly what you are striving for. Though, it might (truthfully) be exactly what you are asking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if the navigation goal is &amp;ldquo;live in a brand new white room, eat whatever you want, close to the sea&amp;rdquo;, the target reality may be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You live in a brand new seaside prison, but the food there is good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You become a sailor and spend most of your time in a white cabin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is not impossible to become a food tycoon and live in a seaside villa. But if no restrictions are set, the navigation direction will be towards the world line that is closest and most likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A false positive is that you have become a food industry tycoon and live in a beachfront villa, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your villa is very humid, and the sea breeze causes water and salt to cover the walls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The shrinking food industry has caused you to be heavily in debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no beach at the beach, and there are strong winds and huge waves all year round&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the goal seems to have been achieved, but there are many problems. At this time, you need to make a course correction and make necessary adjustments to some details. The good news is that a false positive means that you have reached the world line cluster where the goal is located. By modifying the content of the Affirmation and spending more time, reality will get closer to the goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The house is comfortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The climate here is pleasant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The industry is booming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, time passes, and you get where you want to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

        <title>Intention &amp; Navigation in MWI</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intention-navigation-in-mwi/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intention-navigation-in-mwi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Released on April 1st, take it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our thoughts control our reality. So if we want to live a “much improved” life, in whatever way we choose, we can manifest it. By understanding the way the universe works, the nature of consciousness, and the role thought has, you can pick and choose world-line destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that you can direct your consciousness into the craziest, most complex worldline situations you can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that it takes time to manifest through world lines. The more outrageous the intention and desire, the farther the target world line is, and the more world boundaries your consciousness needs to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to obtain the reality we want to inhabit, whatever that is, we need to develop a plan to make that happen. We need to navigate our consciousness through adjacent realities in order to eventually reach our final destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;fundamentals&#34;&gt;Fundamentals
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be able to do this, we need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A map, plan, or schedule of where we want to go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastery of our thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planning---a-map&#34;&gt;Planning - A Map
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are always surprises when doing many things, no matter how big or small. The difficulty of a project is sometimes not well anticipated, and the same is true for world line navigation. Unless you are careful, the reality you live in may have all kinds of surprises. There, it is prudent for you to be careful and concerned when drawing the destination world line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following scenario,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are currently in worldline reality &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo;. It is shown in green.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You eventually want to reach a new reality &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo;. It is shown in gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are two paths marked. One is yellow and one is black.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intention-navigation-in-mwi/WLT01.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1024&#34;
	height=&#34;454&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intention-navigation-in-mwi/WLT01_hu_d105dc7be7416060.png 480w, https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intention-navigation-in-mwi/WLT01_hu_288dc5903388a789.png 1024w&#34;
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;225&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;541px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yellow path is the most direct path. It will require fewer adjacent realities to pass through. The black path is the preferred path. It will take longer, because you will need to pass through more adjacent realities to get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that you want to take the black path over the yellow path is so that you can avoid those problematic realities. They are shown in grey. These realities will bring you turmoil and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when planning, there are a number of factors you need to be absolutely sure of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A destination lifestyle. Clear and easy to visualize. It must be very detailed. There must be no ambiguity in it what so ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporate elements that will guarantee avoidance of problematic adjacent realities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mastery-of-our-thoughts&#34;&gt;Mastery of our thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is to navigate the map we create above, which is often difficult to do because we need to control our thoughts, and modern life does not allow this. All the “fake news,” every ad you see, and all the thoughts of everyone around you influence your thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see that if you want to make your planned end destination a reality, you&amp;rsquo;re going to need to shut down those bad thought streams. That means breaking some long-formed habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;intention&#34;&gt; Intention
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prayer, directed thought, and focus are all great tools, as are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A visualization creation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a listing of what you want&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pray / visualize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a point to alert against bad realities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note that the resulting reality will not be exact. It will be very close to what you want, but you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to specify exact people and exact locations, nor a very constructive level of detail. If you focus on your baseline wishes and desires, the rest will automatically fill in. Of course, it will get more and more accurate over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release&#34;&gt;Release
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what many people believe, this requires a period of forced inactivity. Resting, not doing anything, not even thinking about these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, without this period of stagnation, nothing would happen. After you wind up the car, you can&amp;rsquo;t let it go until it moves forward. If you wind it up all the time, it will stay where it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variables that will influence the timing of reality manifestation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How different and “far out” your goal is from your current reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thoughts and habits that you currently have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thoughts of those around you, especially those of family members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The discipline that you have in doing all of this to make your new world-line realized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-avoid-the-news&#34;&gt;Why avoid the news
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you start browsing MWI using personal intention, you’ll start to realize that all the news isn’t for you. It’s like wallpaper, it doesn’t affect your life in any way other than to scare you and make you cower in fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vocalize-it-loud&#34;&gt;Vocalize it loud
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? And why do you need to say things out loud? Why not just think things instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As consciousness moves across world lines, it switches between wave and particle form. Your thoughts occur while you are in wave form, and through vocalization you can act while you are in particle form. Vocalization not only helps direct and focus the mind, but it is also the easiest action to take, which greatly speeds up goal achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many other methods, using image boards, acting, pretending, and creating scenes. Physical action must be accompanied by directed thought to manifest, and vocalization satisfies this condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

        <title>Law of Attraction Under MWI</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/law-of-attraction-under-mwi/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/law-of-attraction-under-mwi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/law-of-attraction-under-mwi/Law-of-Attraction.png" alt="Featured image of post Law of Attraction Under MWI" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the MWI framework, every possible self you may become and every possible fate you may experience already &amp;ldquo;exists&amp;rdquo; in the universe, but they belong to different branching world lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the process of entering and exiting world lines, through the control of thoughts, we can select and strengthen the path weights of certain world lines, so that life experience tends towards those realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every thought, emotion, intention, and belief is a &amp;ldquo;offset&amp;rdquo; operation on a certain world line. It all starts from the moment consciousness comes into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive, confident, and determined thinking → makes you more likely to move towards a world with positive results;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear, doubt, and self-denial → make you biased towards the branch with low probability and negative results;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means that when you decide to start taking control of your thoughts, you first need to face the thoughts you have had for decades, which have shaped your reality today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since consciousness actually moves in and out of different world lines, we can see that thoughts not only choose/create reality, thoughts are reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because our thoughts determine what world-lines we enter into. So if we are thinking wonderful thoughts, and are calm, and direct our energy into wonderful things, our life would be wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we surround ourselves with negative thoughts, manipulative news, and people. If we are reacting to events instead of manifesting them, or if we hold grudges and evil negative thoughts, then our world experiences will become progressively darker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts create memories, and memories influence thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poverty stricken beggar might yearn for a reality where he has a warm meal and a roof over his head from the rain. While a wealthy oligarch might yearn for forbidden activities, and serendipitous pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This difference is due to their experiences, which are shaped by their memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People discovered this phenomenon and named it the Law of Attraction. In fact, directed thoughts determine their reality.&lt;/p&gt;
