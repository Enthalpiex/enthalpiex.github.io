        <description>&lt;p&gt;Per Aspera Ad Astra, which refers &amp;ldquo;Through suffering to the stars&amp;rdquo;. The specific object of suffering here is still a mystery to me, but it may be a little clearer now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite Chinese translation of this sentence is &amp;ldquo;历尽艰辛，终抵群星&amp;rdquo; (After going through all the hardships, one will finally reach the stars). The brilliance of the second half is easy to understand, but the first half is too vague. What is suffering refers to? Make the right choice at the right time, sacrifice the minor to save the major in critical moment, doing things that are useful but painful, or trying to force progress when motivation is weak?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolate pain may be a great method to avoid it influence the motivation and energy, but what’s interesting is that the isolation method itself also consumes energy. Is this a loss-making exercise or a way to save the greater good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I believe that the final answer will be complex, because of this complicated world.&lt;/p&gt;
