[{"content":"We can never know when an accident will happen.\nToday I learned that the KSPS, which has been running for 3 years, was deleted not long ago and there is no backup.\nThe KSPS KSPS stands for Kerbal Space Program Stack. Its original purpose was to better communicate KSP-related content, including but not limited to works, modules, and some other ideas. Through the support of beautification components, KSPS later became a resource sharing platform based on KSP, with chat room functions.\nAlthough KSPS is gone, BLOG will inherit everything from before, optimize, iterate and update continuously.\n","date":"2024-08-26T00:00:00Z","image":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/from-ksps/pbfymkz6_hu16290370932391832632.png","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/from-ksps/","title":"From KSPS"}]
