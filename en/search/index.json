[{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s January again! Happy new year to you all guys!\nToday\u0026rsquo;s electronic products are thinner and lighter than before, but they are still very heavy, especially those laptops with good performance that weigh more than one kilogram. Today’s quantum computers are larger and heavier than traditional computers—they are housed in specific rooms and run.\nThis prompts us to ask: what kinds of products could define the future? Can we experience the same level of excitement as we did with groundbreaking releases like the MacBook or the iPhone X?\nOne promising candidate is AR glasses powered by directional beam charging technology. Currently, most AR glasses fail to replace smartphones, primarily due to their weight, with bulky batteries being the main culprit. Since this, if we can cancel the battery and use a power bank to charge, also replace the wire to wireless RF (radio frequency) technology, such as millimeter-wave directional transmission, all above problems will be solved.\nThe biggest challenges are: heating problem, high energy consumption ratio chip and High-resolution transparent display.\nThe same technology has the potential to revolutionize aerospace. Traditional space elevators are constrained by material limitations. By eliminating these materials and instead using ion thrusters with vector control to maintain a fixed orbit, coupled with wireless RF technology for power transmission, we could bypass these constraints entirely.\nThis would pave the way for a low-Earth orbit transportation method far more efficient than traditional rockets.\nThe future of technology is brimming with possibilities, although we feel like the technological progress has gradually slowed down or even stalled, but in fact there are still many conceptual technologies that have not been widely used.\n","date":"2025-01-03T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/future/","title":"Future"},{"content":"Hello world!\n","date":"2024-12-27T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/pre-release-test/","title":"Pre-Release Test"},{"content":"Per Aspera Ad Astra, which refers \u0026ldquo;Through suffering to the stars\u0026rdquo;. The specific object of suffering here is still a mystery to me, but it may be a little clearer now.\nMy favorite Chinese translation of this sentence is \u0026ldquo;历尽艰辛，终抵群星\u0026rdquo; (After going through all the hardships, one will finally reach the stars). The brilliance of the second half is easy to understand, but the first half is too vague. What is suffering refers to? Make the right choice at the right time, sacrifice the minor to save the major in critical moment, doing things that are useful but painful, or trying to force progress when motivation is weak?\nIsolate pain may be a great method to avoid it influence the motivation and energy, but what’s interesting is that the isolation method itself also consumes energy. Is this a loss-making exercise or a way to save the greater good?\nInstead, I believe that the final answer will be complex, because of this complicated world.\n","date":"2024-12-09T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/journal-1/","title":"Journal 1"},{"content":"Hard to start? I find that many times I can’t start something because there is so much resistance that stops me. Since this I decided to find reasons out and trying to avoid it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m curious that where is the resistance comes from, and why it appears. Instead, I find following majority reasons, and I listed some solutions or examples I had now.\nFear Fear is considered to be a survival instinct of human beings since ancient times. This instinct could help to protect individuals when they see the unknow beast, and they will run away.\nSame as the modern people, when individuals meets a unknow thing, they will instinctively flee rather than fight.\nSolution: Break down the target into small steps, see what needs to be done in each step (for example, writing an article requires different paragraphs), and make an outline to know everything you need to do. Sometimes a long outline itself can cause fear, so start by focusing on a specific section and giving it a suitable deadline is a good choice. Although deadlines are the first productivity, overly strict deadlines can cause fear and prevent from taking actions. Deadline can be brought forward after the start (e.g. to cut the time in half to improve efficiency), but it cannot be postponed.\nIf the above doesn't work, it means the subdivisions are not simple enough. So try to repeat the above steps for each subdivitions until they do not cause any stress or burden.\nFor tasks with a fixed deadline, try to at least cut the time in half to be more efficient. If the fixed deadline itself is difficult to accomplish, try to start working on it once everything are listed.\nRisk, cost and benefits are not equal, or unpredictable Almost all things have their corresponding sacrifice. Usually time, money, and energy. All things and experience are exchanging between the individual and the world, use currencies above.\nPeople are forced to pay something so most of them couldn\u0026rsquo;t accept failure. If they fail, they lose all the stuff they invested. For most people, the benefits are limited, but everything they put in makes them feel physically or psychologically uncomfortable.\nBecause of this, people tend to choose stop, or even avoid to start due trying to avoid predictable risks, which is a part of the survival instinct.\nFor most things, the total amount of things completed remains the same, the time is reduced, and the energy spent is increased. So there is a limit to the sum of time and energy.\nAlthough this sum is limited, the different distribution of the two will greatly affect the ability to act. More energy and shorter time will cause fear, vice versa. This is because compare to the time, energy limit is more obvious and easier to feel. Less time also refers to have less time to resolve unexpected issues, which stands for bigger risks.\nSolution: Give a looser deadline at the beginning to reduce fear, move deadline forward after start to increase efficiency.\nFor those things doesn't have high benefits relatively, find out its urgency and significance to replace the benefits part. If none of the above is true, avoid doing this useless thing.\nUnclear direction Some individuals may have a big goal but many without details. Not enough details refers unknow, which means fear.\nInstead, unclear direction will stop people to trying to start because they don\u0026rsquo;t know where and how to start.\nSolution: Break things down into enough detail and make an outline so you know what needs to be done and how to get started.\nFor unknown parts, search to obtain content and solutions, calculating impacts.\nNot interesting The brain likes interesting things and dislikes boring things. When people have more interesting options, the brain will try to choose the interesting thing that is useless, rather than the useful but boring thing.\nMany things are indeed useful, but the way they are done is boring, so psychological resistance will be generated to try to prevent them.\nSolution: Find a more interesting way to finish the thing.\nIf the most efficient way to do the thing is not interesting, reduce relative fun. For example, reduce entertainment or ban cell phones (Reduce activities that are considered the most interesting to narrow the gap between the fun of doing serious work and entertainment. A smaller gap will produce less resistance when doing serious work).\nAll above can be summed up in one sentence:\u0026quot;Make the life pure.\u0026quot;\nConclusion 4 Majority reasons: Fear, Risk, cost and benefits are not equal, or unpredictable, Unclear direction, Not interesting.\nSolutions:\n1. Break down the goal and form the outline.\n2. Give a looser deadline at the beginning to reduce fear, move deadline forward after start to increase efficiency.\n3. Avoid doing useless thing.\n4. Searching for unknow parts of plan and fill out the outline.\n5. Find a more interesting way to finish the thing.\n6. Reduce relative fun and make the life pure.\n","date":"2024-11-18T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-makes-action-hard/","title":"What Makes Action Hard?"},{"content":"When I do some review of my past life, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to find that I spend more time on learning, but not applying.

Natural Selection\nBest adapted members of a species survive and reproduce They have favorable characteristics to give to their offspring ‎ 38. Adaptation\nHelps a organism survive and reproduce in a particular environment\nThe process of natural selection means that if there is such a that helps the population survive or produce, it will be inherited to the offspring survivors. As a result, over many generations, they will be more and more individuals with that inherited alliance. These individuals form a population better suitable to the environment. Speciation During speciation, a new species is formed from existing population As natural selection occurs, populations can diverge from each other to such a extent that they create a new species. They can no longer create fertile offspring ‎ 40. Geographical (varies)\nSometimes species can get cut off from one another graphically\nOver time, natural selection and other factors act on mutations in each population, producing new traits that are advantageous to individuals in their environment and are passed from one generation to the next Given enough time, the populations will differ so much, and they become a new species Adaptive Radiation As the environment change, organisms can undergo adaptive radiation. This is when common ancestors split into different species Island is a good example because it isolated the population and forces them to adapt to the environment. ‎\n42. Extinction\nExtinction occurs when a species completely disappeares from the Earth Environmental influence create selective pressure and these influence can either create a new species or existing new species may go extinct ‎ 43. Carcinogen\nAre mutagens that causes cancer\ne.x. - increase exposure to ultraviolet rays increase the chances of skin cancer, smoking can increase chains of lung cancer Artificial Selection Selective pressure exerted by humans on population in order to improve or modify desirable traits Also call this artificial breeding Most of food we eat grains, fruits, vegetables, meat and milk comes from a species we have selectively bred Artificial selections has caused cows to produce more milk, chicken have been bred to grow faster ‎ 45.

The amount of solar radiation that reaches the certain area is called insolation.\n42. Incidence\nAngle between a ray reaching the earth surface and a line perpendicular to the surface\n43. Radiation Budget\nBalance ingoing and outgoing energy. Incoming short wave solar radiation is reflected and absorbed to various degrees\n44. Albedo\nDescribes the amount of radiation reflected by earth surface Low Albedo-Absorb more radiation High Albedo-Reflect more radiation\n45. Atmospheric Pressure\nAtmospheric pressure is a pressure exerted by mass of air above any point on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface\n46. Barometer\nUsed to measure atmospheric pressure in kilopascals (kpa) The flexible metal capsule in the barometer expands and contracts as air pressure changes.\n47. Altitude and pressure\nAs the altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases\n48. Temperature and pressure\nWarm air is less dens than cold air, resulting in lower atmospheric pressure\n49. Humidity\nMeasurement describes the amount of water vapor in the air Greater humidity cause lower atmospheric pressure\n49. Air mass\nA mass of air with similar temperature and humidity throughout an area When cool air forms over a cool region a high pressure system forms\n50. Front\nA boundary between two air masses\n51. Weather\nA condition of the atmosphere in a specific place and a specific time Temperature, Atmospheric pressure, Humidity, Wind speed and direction Closely connected to heat transfer in the atmosphere\n52. Tornado\nViolent funnel-shaped column High-altitude meets large thunderstorm When warm, moist air rises into the atmosphere, rain is produced and heat energy is released Warm air rushes into the atmosphere, displacing cool air, creating the Coriolis effect\n53. Wind\nMovement of air from high pressure area to low pressure area. Geographic features such as mountains, oceans, and lakes greatly affect the characteristics of local winds\n54. Prevailing Winds\nTypical winds for a certain region\n55. Coriolis Effect\nChange in direction of moving air, water or objects due to the earths rotation Coriolis effect and convection results in three major global wind systems Trade winds, Prevailing Westerlies, Polar Easterlies\nPart IV - 3.32 Natural Causes of Climate Change 56. Climate\nDescribes the average conditions of the atmosphere in a region over 30 years or more Includes Clouds, Precipitation, Average Temperature, Humidity, Atmospheric Pressure, Solar Radiation, and Winds Climate can refer to a region as small as an island or as large as a planet\n57. Biogeoclimatic Zones\nA region with a certain type of plant life, soil geography and climate 14 zones in BC\n58. Climate Change\nClimate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns Natural causes-Greenhouse Gases, Volcanic Eruptions, Earth\u0026rsquo;s Orbital Changes, Earth\u0026rsquo;s tilt Changes, Ocean Currents Human causes-Burning of Fossil Fuels, Agriculture, Use of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) Effect redistribution of thermal energy around the world\n59. Paleoclimatologist\nStudy fossils and sediments or gather information about glaciers to help them understand climate change\n60. Ice cores\nSamples taken help us determine what types and amount of gases existed in the atmosphere when the ice was formed By reviewing CO2 data scientists can estimate the climate for the last 650,000 years\n60. Affect Climate Change\n$$ ↑Greenhouse{ }Gases↑Temperature $$ Earth tilt, axis of rotation and orbit around the Sun-Earth experiences seasonal changes due to a combination of its tilt and orbit. When the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotation angle is between 22.1 and 24.5, the Earth\u0026rsquo;s tilt is greatest, changing the angle of the incidence\n61. Carbon Cycle\nThe carbon cycle maintains the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is an important greenhouse gas\n62. Carbon Sinks\nDeep ocean shelled organism, forest, removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere Carbon is converted to carbohydrates in shells of many shelled organisms\n63. Carbon Sources\nWeathering and decaying vegetation add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere\n64. Catastrophic Events\nLarge disasters such as volcanic eruptions and meteorite impacts can send dust, debris and gases into the atmosphere, which reflect and absorb solar radiation, causing the Earth to cool.\n65. Water Cycle (C.P.E.T)\nCirculation of water on, above and under the earth surface\nCondensation-As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it gains gravitational potential energy. It also releases thermal energy to air molecules through collisions. It then cools, condenses around particles in the atmosphere and form clouds. The condensation process more thermal energy to the atmosphere. Precipitation- The water returns to Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface through precipitation when it rains or snows, as the precipitation falls, its gravitational potential energy is transformed into mechanical kinetic energy. This transformation continues as water flows from higher to lower level on the land. Thermal energy is also transferred to the atmosphere through friction as precipitation falls. Evaporation- When water absorbs the sun\u0026rsquo;s energy, the molecules begin to move faster as the solar energy is transformed into thermal energy. If enough solar energy is transformed, water evaporates from Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface. It enters the atmosphere as water vapor, bringing the thermal energy with it. Transpiration- In transpiration plants take up water from ground or bodies of water. In the case of aquatic plants and release into the atmosphere as water vapor like evaporation, transpiration moves thermal energy into the atmosphere. $$ ↑Temperature↑Watervapor↑HoldAbility $$ Captures more thermal energy, causing the temperature to rise further\n66. Ocean Currents\nThe sinking and rising of deep ocean water creates convection currents that act as a global conveyor belt, transporting water and thermal energy around the Earth\n67. El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\nEl Niño-Weaken trade winds, warm water move eastward. Canada \u0026amp; northern U.S. warmer and dryer La Niña-Stronger trade wind, warm water pushed back to Asia, cool water rises. Canada \u0026amp; northern U.S. cooler and more precipitation Part V - 3.33 Human Activity and Climate Change 68. Global Warming\nGlobal average temperature increase\n69. Enhanced Greenhouse Effect\nIncreased capacity of the atmosphere to absorb and emit thermal energy because of increase in greenhouse gases\n69. Global Warming Potential (GWP)\n$$ ↑GWP↑WarmingAbility $$ Water Vapor 65% CO2 25% Other gases 10%\n70. Carbon Dioxide (CO2)\nAtmospheric life: Variable Human activity: Fossil Fuel, Deforestation GWP 1\n71. Methane (CH4)\nAtmospheric life: 12 years Human activity: Fossil Fuel, Agriculture, Waste Dumps GWP 25\n72. Nitrous Oxide (N2O)\nAtmospheric life: 114 years Human activity: Production of chemical fertilizers GWP 298\n73. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)\nAtmospheric life: 45 years Human activity: Liquid coolant, Refrigerant, Air Conditions GWP 4750~5130\n73. CGM Models\nComputer generated model to study climate They take into account multiple factors such as changing in greenhouse gas concentrations, ocean current, wind, surface temperature and albedo\nPart VI - 3.34 Energy Transformation \u0026amp; Global Systems 74. Earth Energy System\nThree main types of energy are responsible for Earths System. Solar Energy Created by Sun Gravitational Potential Energy Created by earth Nuclear Energy Found in nucleus\n75. Solar Energy\nSolar energy drives the water cycle and sustains life on the Earth by providing energy for photosynthesis Solar energy made up by electromagnetic radiation of different wavelengths.\tThese waves transformed into thermal energy when they interact with matter.\tAbout half of this energy enters the Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere, while visible light tends to pass through the atmosphere and reach the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface unchanged. When it reaches the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface, it is converted into thermal energy. It is then radiated into the surroundings in the form of Infrared radiation. It temporarily transfers part of the energy and heat, which plays an important role in the warming of the atmosphere.\n76. Conduction\nAfter land and water absorb solar energy, the molecules collide more frequently with air molecules close to the surface. This collisions transfer thermal energy as a result of temperature of the lower air comes close to the land temperature This triggers convection.\n77. Convection\n$$ AirWarms\\to Expands\\to BecomeLessDense $$ Less dense air rises and cooler, more dense air sinks\n78. Infrared Radiation\nPlay the largest role It helps warm the atmosphere, preventing the Earth from becoming overheated and radiating energy out of the atmosphere\n79. Water Cycle \u0026amp; Cooling Effect\nWater Cycle moderation of earth surface temperature water absorbs a lot of energy when it evaporates. This causes cooling effect\n80. Specific Heat Capacity\nThe amount of energy needed to change the temperature of 1g of a substance 1℃ Earth\u0026rsquo;s vast ocean can store a vast amount of thermal energy with very little change in temperature. Ocean transfer and radiate energy to their colder surroundings. This happened slowly. Without this effect, the Earth would experience radical shifts in temperature between day and night. It would also be much hotter in the summer and much colder in the winter.\n","date":"2024-08-03T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/bc-g10-science-physics-unit-review-sheet/","title":"BC G10 Science Physics Unit Review Sheet"},{"content":"I just saw an interesting comment on bilibili, the original text is as follows:\nIf there are other civilizations in the universe that are more developed than humans, I think their world must be extremely neat and tidy cities, with sharp buildings, obvious artificial features in landform transformation and various functional areas, and the operation of the city depends on powerful central supercomputer control. Aliens may look special, but they will have a lot of auxiliary equipment on their bodies, their thoughts will be more mature than humans, their logical ability will be stronger, and their emotions will fluctuate less, which is equivalent to the artificial intelligence life form in the human science fiction world. Perhaps these aliens are the silicon-based civilization heritage left behind after the disappearance of the carbon-based civilization of the planet, making these intelligent machines created to serve carbon-based creatures the new heirs of civilization.\nThe reason why alien civilizations can continue to develop must be that they are a race with less internal friction, high teamwork ability, and diverse means of observing the world. Less internal friction means that their civilization will not collapse due to resource competition, teamwork ability means high production efficiency, and diverse means of observing the world means a deeper understanding of the physical rules of the universe, so this is the reason why alien civilizations are more developed than the earth.\nAlien civilizations are definitely not absurd and weird cities, chaotic buildings, and backward and barbaric ideas. Such a population cannot be at the forefront of developed civilizations, but will consume each other in the competition for resources and go to destruction. Savage thoughts also mean increasing the risk of internal friction, becoming the fuse of civilization destruction.\nSome more advanced civilizations may be related to their special environment, with abundant sunshine, vast territory, rich mineral resources, and special metal materials, which means that their energy acquisition methods are easier and more abundant. It is possible that aliens can absorb and store energy themselves, and may convert energy in an efficient way to achieve almost no loss.\nI dare not imagine how fierce it will be in Star Wars when each civilization uses the biggest killer of their planet to launch it on the battlefield, and various aliens divide the work and cooperate in production, defense, confrontation, and plunder. They use various battleship tactics and technology to fight for space resources, and they will also form alliances with neighboring galaxy civilizations to develop resources. It is more likely to form a situation of confrontation between multiple forces, and the battlefield is full of star-shaped battleship wreckage.\nAlthough it is just a restatement of science fiction movies and novels, it is quite interesting :D\n","date":"2024-03-12T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/starfield/","title":"Starfield?"},{"content":"This can be said to be the worst month.

In 2024, Extremely Efficiency will inherit this and use it as a basis for rapid iteration and practice of various theories.\nEndorphins and long-termism: Increase endorphins and reduce dopamine through long-termism and sustainable actions. Physical and mental health is the basis for achieving goals, and long-term persistence in action and maintaining high efficiency can lead to better results and endorphin income.\nResult oriented: One of the biggest changes in 2024 is to change from plan-oriented to result-oriented. Results are evaluated directly by goals, rather than by whether the plan is completed. Result orientation pays more attention to the direct connection between the completed content and the goal, so as to know where you are.\nRapid iteration and experimentalism: Rapid iteration can quickly improve the unreasonable aspects of theory or practice, and quickly improve through continuous trial and error to achieve the final results. experimentalism is the biggest helper when facing unknown theories or events.
