[{"content":"As a fan of hardcore simulation games, I have dabbled in simulation games in various fields, including FPS games. However, as we can see, hardcore simulation FPS is very different from mainstream FPS, so I tend to divide all FPS into three types: hardcore, semi-simulation and entertainment. The first type of hardcore includes Arma, Squad, Ready or Not, Escape from Tarkov, Ground Branch and other works, and the second type of semi-simulation is Insurgency: Sandstorm, Battlefield, DayZ and so on. Entertainment is relatively broad, including Call of Duty, Apex Legends, Counter-Strike, Fortnite and so on.\nThrough the level of simulation, we can know the degree of \u0026ldquo;hardcore\u0026rdquo;.\nDimension Judgment criteria Damage model/TTK One or two shots kill, no blood recovery; wound type segmentation Ballistic physics There are drop, wind deflection, penetration, initial velocity, bullet type differences, etc. Operation complexity Switch safety, pull bolt, manually load magazine, check ammunition Modification freedom Generally high, including gun modification details and customized full body equipment Interface/information No HUD, no crosshairs, no radar Tactical dependence Strong reliance on teamwork, voice communication, tactical coordination Real rules Military communication, medical, supply, logistics system Map Huge map (strategic) or small map (tactical), always realistic Death penalty Zero cost or high cost Relatively speaking, the more hardcore the game, the fewer players there are, and the higher the level required of the developer.\nDeath penalty, is a big difference between hardcore FPS games. Some of them (e.x. Tarkov) set up a extremely serious penalty, but some have almost no penalty (e.x. RoN).\nNow there is a interesting topic: Despite hardcore FPS is difficult, why do people still like to play it?\nObviously, there are reasons for this. From a general perspective, it includes the following factors:\nImmersion Whether it is a visual work or a novel, immersion has always been an important evaluation dimension. Novels and visual works often use gorgeous pictures and texts to attract the audience, while hardcore FPS games go the opposite way, bringing an immersive feeling by simulating the real environment as much as possible.\nThe pursuit of realistic gameplay is also about the real environment. This will make the modeling and rendering effects of hardcore FPS much higher than those of mainstream FPS. The more realistic reflections and volumetric clouds/fog can sometimes be comparable to 3A works.\nTeamwork \u0026amp; Communication Unlike twitchy shooters where you can solo carry, hardcore FPS always demands cooperation. You can be John Wick, but it\u0026rsquo;s almost impossible. In Ready Or Not, solo CQB is extremely dangerous and no one would try or recommend it in real life.\nSkill Learning Hardcore FPS rewards system for correct knowledge application, patience and discipline, not just quick reaction, not gun. Learning bullet trajectory, equipment management, tactical movements and communication cooperation management does not provide any rewards in itself, but by using these to successfully complete the mission, you will know what is useful.\nTake Ready or Not as an example Hardcore FPS games often have RPG elements, and RoN is particularly good at this. In RoN, a few bullets = death. One clean shot can end you, without health regen. You can get crippled, bleed out, or go down instantly.\nThis makes every action must meet the standard, and rushing out of the cover directly is asking for trouble. The game does not reward recklessness, nor does it deduct points for taking extra time. Caution is often the best, even if it takes more time. It is stressful, but it feels real. Surviving a mission with zero casualties feels rewarding.\nIn RoN, bullet penetration is real. Cover is not always safe. Your 9mm bullet will not penetrate wood like a 5.56. Walls can be full of holes and you may not know which hole a suspect is shooting from. If you don\u0026rsquo;t crouch down and hold your shield, your shield will shake and you will take damage. There is no sliding, jumping or even running here. In real life, no one wants the sound of running footsteps to alert the suspect to the arrival of SWAT.\nIn RoN, there is no gear loss like in Tarkov, you get an F for failing a mission, and losing a teammate means a lower score. Unexpected deaths are stressful. It is the ultimate realization of \u0026ldquo;tactical fantasy\u0026rdquo;. Perfect coordination, precise point shooting, correct use of tactical weapons, clearing suspects without injury and completing the mission itself carries a sense of professionalism and coolness.\nFeatures Mainstream FPS Ready or Not Objective Kill to win / Win the game Complete the mission / Rescue the hostages / Clear the target Death penalty Drop rank Mission failure Player behavior Reaction, luck, shooting Tactics, judgment, coordination Atmosphere Exciting but chaotic Calm, depressing, realistic AI enemies Stupid Relatively smart + deceptive (fake surrender, attack from behind) Gameplay Fast pace\nrestart after the game Slow pace\nfocus on process and details In summary, the charm of RoN lies in that it forces you to restrain, learn, bear the consequences, learn the practices of real SWAT teams, understand the importance of cover, and truly learn CQB.\nThe game is not just a simulation of SWAT, but it trains players to become SWAT and understand the thinking of SWAT when performing tasks. Players start to find cover as much as possible, instead of \u0026ldquo;gunning\u0026rdquo; or blindly entering open areas, start to prioritize controlling the perspective, instead of blindly pushing the map, and learn how to let teammates cover themselves, instead of being a lone wolf hero. Skilled and realistic operations are accumulated through repeated officer downs.\nGenerally speaking, the community environment of this type of tactical shooting/hardcore FPS games is more equal and friendly, there is generally no ranking system, everyone respects each other more, even if the skills are not good, they will only say that you are unprofessional. It is not like the mainstream FPS where the high rankings look down on the low ones and scold teammates for mistakes. In theory, the death penalty of the former is higher. Why can\u0026rsquo;t mainstream FPS players accept failure?\nObviously, we can find that in hardcore FPS, death is often quick and fatal, but the game rhythm is slow, and cooperation is more important than individual performance. A mistake often leads to the failure of the entire team. Failure is serious, but also very natural. Players understand that anyone can be killed, not who is too bad. \u0026ldquo;Teamwork is more important than individual skills\u0026rdquo; is reflected here.\nIn mainstream FPS, the fast-paced environment, leaderboards and quantitative indicators such as KDA are very prominent. Failure is seen as a lack of personal ability, and teammates are prone to accusing or dragging the team down. This is because in a battle, a highly skilled person can defeat others 1v10 through various \u0026ldquo;skills\u0026rdquo; and techniques. In this type of game, there are no Rules of Engagement, but Rules of Elimination. Recklessness is rewarded, and caution is punished.\nThe difference between the two communities is also huge. Hardcore FPS game communities are usually dominated by players who like military simulations and teamwork. They emphasize \u0026ldquo;respecting tactical processes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;learning and communication\u0026rdquo;. Poor skills can also be seen as a need for practice, and the community is more inclined to guidance/discussion rather than malicious attacks.\nThe mainstream FPS community has a larger player base with varying levels of skill. Rankings and popularity make the competition more stressful, and players are more likely to be anxious or emotional. The language environment is more likely to become a battlefield because the game rhythm is intense and the emotions fluctuate greatly.\nFactors Tactical shooting games Mainstream FPS Rhythm and failure Slow pace, high cost of failure, team responsibility Fast pace, high pressure on individual performance Community atmosphere Cooperation first Intense competition, obvious comparison Ranking influence No or weak ranking, reduced comparison Kill quantification, high pressure on ranking Failure acceptance Failure is a learning process Failure is seen as a lack of ability Player screening Like immersion and rigor Diversity, complex mentality Idealized Education System Inspired by hardcore FPS, we found that increasing difficulty and removing competition will not repel players, but will make players actively learn and research, stimulating the motivation of independent learning. So how can we change the education system?\nThe core concept is that students are not trained to \u0026ldquo;win the game\u0026rdquo; (grades), but to train like athletes. Not only pass, but also solve real problems and gain the ability to solve problems.\nFirst step: Exam Changes Multiple exams are allowed, multiple attempts are allowed, no time limit. In fact, the role of rankings is just to increase pressure, and the so-called positive effect is just to promote the superiority of those who rank high and to discourage those who rank low. This is why they need to be removed in the first place. A more open evaluation method can reduce the focus on grades and focus more on something truly valuable. The penalties for poor test scores should be weakened, and more time should be spent on reviewing and retrying.\nSecond step: More Teamwork All core learning tasks need to be completed through real collaboration. The difficulty and cost of completing the task by one person must be set very high. By encouraging real cooperation, rather than forcing tasks to be bound without any interests. The task must be in everyone\u0026rsquo;s interest and related to the interests of the group. Group members need to be randomly assigned.\nThird step: Pacing Self-paced, independent time planning. Unlike a universal learning pace that is synchronized for all students, each individual\u0026rsquo;s pace should be different, the pace should be suitable for them, and they should not know each other.\nFourth step: Minimal Guidance Minimal, limited, appropriate guidance. Minimal guidance and prompting and the removal of time limits allow students to learn to observe, analyze, and act early in their learning. The subsequent pace of learning can naturally accelerate, and students have very strong autonomous learning abilities.\nFifth step: Comprehensive Rating Feedback Debriefing, report, portfolios instead of rankings, class placement, GPA. The core of the evaluation should not be based on standardized test scores, but on actual results, works and discussions. Less passive memorization of instruction and more integration into project learning objectives.\nKey Point of Idealized Education System Mission-Based Curriculum \u0026amp; Learning through Immersion Each subject has a clear target application scenario. The number of application questions should not be increased, but reduced and as few as possible with high quality. Project objectives should be exactly in line with the subject. They should not be designed to be too simple, as that would lose interest. Simple knowledge points should use simpler question formats, while project learning objectives should be more complex and often have no unified answer.\nDesign and test a bridge with given constraints. Role-play policy advisors in historical turning points. Allow Slow, Tactical Pacing You shouldn’t pursue speed in the early stages of learning, which is why time limits are removed. Not everyone learns at the same speed, so the time it takes for everyone to reach a certain point will also be different. Practice on the basis of excellent quality, and speed will also be improved on the basis of excellent quality. Quality always takes precedence over speed. The same is true in the market. There is no shortage of products, but there is a shortage of excellent products, and even more so, great products. Over time, good and fast.\nEncourage pauses for reflection Allows retrying of failed methods with better planning Normalize debriefs after major assignments Team Accountability Traditional classes are still too large organizations. Ideally, each group should not exceed 5 people, and individual achievements need to be balanced with collective achievements. Too large a collective organization will drown out individual achievements, and too small an organization is not conducive to the development of collaborative skills.\nClear roles Team success \u0026gt; individual brilliance Built-in peer review Natural Punishment and Reward Grades replaced or supported by:\nPlanning and assigning Task completion Requirement achievement Post-mission reports \u0026amp; Reflections Respect-Based Community In RoN, failure is expected, and support is constructive. Facts have also proved that positive thoughts are always more conducive to learning and progress than negative emotions.\nRemove rigid ranking systems Emphasize shared growth Use feedback instead of shame Replace “gifted vs. average” with “trained vs. untrained” Conclusion To sum up the above, we find that the high difficulty represented by hardcore FPS games is not disgusting. We can improve the learning environment that is also considered to be difficult in the same way, thereby improving our perception and enthusiasm for learning.\nEncourage deep, experiential learning over fast test-taking. Cultivate teamwork and communication as a central skill. Embrace failure as tactical feedback, not personal inadequacy. Quality always over speed. Treat students as person in training, not score chasers. Make learning immersive, strategic, and professionally.

In fact, it is more likely that all the divergent world lines themselves have always existed and formed a \u0026ldquo;grid\u0026rdquo; in which consciousness constantly shuttles.\nIf time travel is possible in such a framework, then the traveler is not moving backwards along a single timeline. We know that the traveler is actually constantly traveling between worldlines, so their arrival in the \u0026ldquo;past\u0026rdquo; will result in the creation or intersection of a new worldline, a parallel branch that diverges from the point of arrival.\nIn this branching structure, meeting a version of your past self is plausible. However, the \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo; that exists in that past is not the exact same entity that became the future traveler. Rather, it is a copy on a parallel worldline. The moment you travel back, you create or join a branch where both versions of you co-exist, and their timelines may continue independently.\nHowever, we also know that shadow people do not have a dominant consciousness, which means you will meet your shadow people.\nWhy the Grandfather Paradox Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Occur Because of this branching, any actions taken in the \u0026ldquo;past\u0026rdquo; do not overwrite the traveler\u0026rsquo;s origin timeline. If you were to stop your grandfather from having children in that new branch, it would not affect the original branch from which you came. Instead, it would only change the course of history in that particular parallel world.\nIn this way, causality is preserved within each branch, and no contradictions arise. The original sequence of events that led to your birth remains intact in your original worldline, even if you prevent it in another.\nIn other words, your shadow copy has no logical connection with you.\nConclusion In our MWI framework, there is only one dominant consciousness, so even if the dominant consciousness returns to the world lines it has been to, it will only encounter its own \u0026ldquo;shadow man\u0026rdquo;. This will not cause the dominant consciousness to suddenly visit itself in its memory, because the dominant consciousness returns to that world line after it has experienced that world line. The dominant consciousness\u0026rsquo;s memory will not change because it does not have the experience of the \u0026ldquo;shadow man\u0026rdquo; on the world line it returned to.\nTherefore, in theory, there is nothing wrong with killing your grandfather. Furthermore, if your grandfather has passed away, then you have not actually killed anyone, because at this time all \u0026ldquo;grandfathers\u0026rdquo; are just empty shells, and the dominant consciousness has left.\nIn MWI, time travel is as easy as moving around in the three-dimensional world.\n","date":"2025-05-17T00:00:00Z","image":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/time-travel-in-mwi/TVL_hu_c21e79f8998b8c87.png","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/time-travel-in-mwi/","title":"Time Travel in MWI"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m trying to sort out some blogs that might disappear at any time.

These people and animals are called \u0026ldquo;shadows\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;shadow people\u0026rdquo; because while they appear to move and think, they have no consciousness. They are projections of consciousness, and their main consciousness is somewhere else. They are the \u0026ldquo;what ifs\u0026rdquo; of the action and the landscape that your consciousness interacts with.\nTo visualize:\nHowever, this is a simplification. In reality, all the “shadow people” possess a consciousness. This explains why the thoughts of those around you affect your MWI navigation.\nThere is some small percentage of a consciousness within every shadow entity. It’s just that the percentage is very tiny.\nEach of the infinite lines of the world has consciousness running through it. Not just other people\u0026rsquo;s, but yours as well. It\u0026rsquo;s an almost insignificant amount. Your consciousness dominates all other consciousnesses in the world line.\nSome explanations In quantum physics, when two quanta meet, they become entangled.\nAnd in the realm outside of our reality; the one that contains all the near-infinite numbers of world-lines, there isn’t any time or space. It’s a region with no geometry. So everything can entangle in a quantum sense.\nThis means there is no world-lines are independent. They are all connected to each other.\nWhat is actually happening is that clusters of world-lines entangle with other clusters of world-lines. They do this when ever a consciousness is injected into a world-line template.\nAnd all of this entanglement puts a little infinitesimal part of you, and those around you near you in what ever world-line that your consciousness happens to occupy at that moment.\nOf course, there are other factors at play. Injecting consciousness into a template does not mean that the entire infinite number of world lines are entangled. The effect will \u0026ldquo;fade out,\u0026rdquo; or diminish as the variance increases.\nIt will resemble something like:\nThe ability of a consciousness to entangle with “close proximity” world-lines happens automatically. However, the ability for the entangled world-lines to entangle with other world-lines drops off as the degree of variance increases.\nConsider that this is happening for the billions upon billions of people that are entering and leaving our template surface. Each one is “making their marks”. All combine to provide some “foot print” of their present upon the template that you inhabit.\nParadox Assuming that everyone was 100% fully conscious in their bodies, and that the mind controlled our reality, our reality would probably become a very confusing, ever-changing mess of reality. Reality will also change as quickly and irrationally as dreams.\nIf a person\u0026rsquo;s consciousness is the dominant consciousness in the world line he lives in, it means that his thoughts are also the dominant thoughts in the world line.\nBy controlling and directing thoughts, we can not only control our navigation, but our influence in the strong quantum entanglements of “near-by” (but untraveled) world-lines means that we have the potential to influence the trends and behaviors of the environment around us.\n","date":"2025-04-30T00:00:00Z","image":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/SP04_hu_ead38b2c702722c0.png","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/shadow-people-in-mwi/","title":"Shadow People in MWI"},{"content":"Eccirian is a security-focused Obsidian encryption plugin that supports seamless encryption and decryption of files using multiple advanced password-based encryption methods.\nIt introduces a custom .eccirian file extension and provides a unique read-only view for locked files, allowing you to easily manage sensitive information directly in Obsidian.\nFeatures 🔁 One-click encryption and decryption of .md files (or any other types) into .eccirian, and vice versa. 🔒 AES-256-CGM and ECC-P-256 based password encryption. 📄 Custom eccirian-view that shows a locked message instead of the default editor. 🧷 Files remain read-only until unlocked via user input. ⚙️ UI and control panel support. 📦 Modular architecture for maintainability and expansion.pansion.

So if we want to live a “much improved” life, in whatever way we choose, we can manifest it. By understanding the way the universe works, the nature of consciousness, and the role thought has, you can pick and choose world-line destinations.\nThis means that you can direct your consciousness into the craziest, most complex worldline situations you can think of.\nThe only problem is that it takes time to manifest through world lines. The more outrageous the intention and desire, the farther the target world line is, and the more world boundaries your consciousness needs to pass through.\nSo to obtain the reality we want to inhabit, whatever that is, we need to develop a plan to make that happen. We need to navigate our consciousness through adjacent realities in order to eventually reach our final destination.\nFundamentals To be able to do this, we need:\nA map, plan, or schedule of where we want to go. Mastery of our thoughts. Planning - A Map There are always surprises when doing many things, no matter how big or small. The difficulty of a project is sometimes not well anticipated, and the same is true for world line navigation. Unless you are careful, the reality you live in may have all kinds of surprises. There, it is prudent for you to be careful and concerned when drawing the destination world line.\nIn the following scenario,\nYou are currently in worldline reality \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo;. It is shown in green. You eventually want to reach a new reality \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo;. It is shown in gold. There are two paths marked. One is yellow and one is black. The yellow path is the most direct path. It will require fewer adjacent realities to pass through. The black path is the preferred path. It will take longer, because you will need to pass through more adjacent realities to get to it.\nThe reason that you want to take the black path over the yellow path is so that you can avoid those problematic realities. They are shown in grey. These realities will bring you turmoil and pain.\nTherefore, when planning, there are a number of factors you need to be absolutely sure of:\nA destination lifestyle. Clear and easy to visualize. It must be very detailed. There must be no ambiguity in it what so ever. Incorporate elements that will guarantee avoidance of problematic adjacent realities. Mastery of our thoughts The key is to navigate the map we create above, which is often difficult to do because we need to control our thoughts, and modern life does not allow this. All the “fake news,” every ad you see, and all the thoughts of everyone around you influence your thinking.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to see that if you want to make your planned end destination a reality, you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to shut down those bad thought streams. That means breaking some long-formed habits.\nIntention Prayer, directed thought, and focus are all great tools, as are:\nA visualization creation Create a listing of what you want Pray / visualize Make a point to alert against bad realities Also note that the resulting reality will not be exact. It will be very close to what you want, but you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to specify exact people and exact locations, nor a very constructive level of detail. If you focus on your baseline wishes and desires, the rest will automatically fill in. Of course, it will get more and more accurate over time.\nRelease Contrary to what many people believe, this requires a period of forced inactivity. Resting, not doing anything, not even thinking about these goals.\nUnfortunately, without this period of stagnation, nothing would happen. After you wind up the car, you can\u0026rsquo;t let it go until it moves forward. If you wind it up all the time, it will stay where it is.\nThe variables that will influence the timing of reality manifestation:\nHow different and “far out” your goal is from your current reality. The thoughts and habits that you currently have. The thoughts of those around you, especially those of family members. The discipline that you have in doing all of this to make your new world-line realized. Why avoid the news Once you start browsing MWI using personal intention, you’ll start to realize that all the news isn’t for you. It’s like wallpaper, it doesn’t affect your life in any way other than to scare you and make you cower in fear.\nVocalize it loud Why does this matter? And why do you need to say things out loud? Why not just think things instead?\nAs consciousness moves across world lines, it switches between wave and particle form. Your thoughts occur while you are in wave form, and through vocalization you can act while you are in particle form. Vocalization not only helps direct and focus the mind, but it is also the easiest action to take, which greatly speeds up goal achievement.\nOf course, there are many other methods, using image boards, acting, pretending, and creating scenes. Physical action must be accompanied by directed thought to manifest, and vocalization satisfies this condition.\n","date":"2025-04-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intention-navigation-in-mwi/","title":"Intention \u0026 Navigation in MWI"},{"content":"In the MWI framework, every possible self you may become and every possible fate you may experience already \u0026ldquo;exists\u0026rdquo; in the universe, but they belong to different branching world lines.\nTherefore, in the process of entering and exiting world lines, through the control of thoughts, we can select and strengthen the path weights of certain world lines, so that life experience tends towards those realities.\nEvery thought, emotion, intention, and belief is a \u0026ldquo;offset\u0026rdquo; operation on a certain world line. It all starts from the moment consciousness comes into the world.\nPositive, confident, and determined thinking → makes you more likely to move towards a world with positive results; Fear, doubt, and self-denial → make you biased towards the branch with low probability and negative results; This also means that when you decide to start taking control of your thoughts, you first need to face the thoughts you have had for decades, which have shaped your reality today.\nSince consciousness actually moves in and out of different world lines, we can see that thoughts not only choose/create reality, thoughts are reality.\nBecause our thoughts determine what world-lines we enter into. So if we are thinking wonderful thoughts, and are calm, and direct our energy into wonderful things, our life would be wonderful.\nBut if we surround ourselves with negative thoughts, manipulative news, and people. If we are reacting to events instead of manifesting them, or if we hold grudges and evil negative thoughts, then our world experiences will become progressively darker.\nThoughts create memories, and memories influence thoughts.\nA poverty stricken beggar might yearn for a reality where he has a warm meal and a roof over his head from the rain. While a wealthy oligarch might yearn for forbidden activities, and serendipitous pursuits.\nThis difference is due to their experiences, which are shaped by their memories.\nPeople discovered this phenomenon and named it the Law of Attraction.

This wavefunction contains all possible outcomes of a system.\nCopenhagen Interpretation vs. MWI From the experiment we can know that:\nBefore measurement, particles exist in a superposition of all possible states. After measurement, we observe one definite outcome. But where do the results come from?\nThe Copenhagen Interpretation, developed primarily by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in the 1920s, was the first and most widely accepted explanation of this puzzle.\nThe main idea includes:\nThe wavefunction represents our knowledge of a system, not objective reality. When a measurement is made, the wavefunction collapses into a single outcome. Prior to observation, physical properties are undefined or \u0026ldquo;potential.\u0026rdquo; But it is clear that the Copenhagen interpretation suffers from a great deal of ambiguity: it has no clear way of defining “observation” or the observer, nor does it explain what actually exists before the observation.\nIn 1957, physicist Hugh Everett III proposed the Many-Worlds Interpretation as a clean, deterministic alternative to Copenhagen.\nIn this theory:\nThe wavefunction never collapses. All possible outcomes of quantum events actually happen—in separate branches of the universe. Measurement causes decoherence, not collapse: the world \u0026ldquo;splits\u0026rdquo; into multiple, non-interacting outcomes. For example:\nA particle in superposition doesn’t choose one outcome. Instead, the universe branches, and each outcome occurs in its own “world.” Further reasoning, any \u0026ldquo;forking\u0026rdquo; behavior may not exist, but the world line corresponding to each result itself always exists, and the observer moves between these worlds.\nSchrödinger\u0026rsquo;s Cat Erwin Schrödinger proposed his famous thought experiment in 1935:\nImagine a cat sealed in a box. Inside, there is a radioactive atom with a 50% chance to decay in one hour. If it decays, a Geiger counter triggers a hammer that breaks a vial of poison, killing the cat. If it doesn’t decay, the cat lives. In the Copenhagen interpretation, the system remains in superposition (cat is dead and alive) until a measurement is made. At the moment of observation, the wavefunction collapses into one of the two possibilities:\nYou see a live cat, or You see a dead cat. Only one outcome becomes real, and the other disappears. The act of observation causes reality to “choose.”\nMWI gives a different answer:\nThe cat is both dead and alive, but in different worlds. In one branch of the universe, the atom decays → poison is released → the cat dies. In another branch, the atom does not decay → the poison is not released → the cat lives. These two outcomes both happen, in separate branches of reality. There is no collapse but decoherence, which prevents the branches from interfering with each other:\nWhen you open the box, you also become part of the superposition: One version of you sees a dead cat. Another version sees a live cat. From your perspective as the observer:\nYou will experience only one outcome (say, the live cat). But another version of you, equally real, experiences the other outcome (dead cat). You and your alternate self now live in separate, non-interacting worlds. From the above content, we can find that if MWI exists, the world will be \u0026ldquo;split\u0026rdquo; all the time, and the observer will move all the time, from one world to another. For the sake of distinction, the \u0026ldquo;world\u0026rdquo; will be called \u0026ldquo;world line\u0026rdquo; to more accurately describe the history and future of each world.\nMWI and Reality The MWI is a large universe of possibilities. And each possibility is a frozen moment that our consciousness briefly visits. On top of this, our consciousness is constantly moving in and out of different realities. Since each reality is its own unique worldline, we can say that we are moving in and out of different worldlines.\nWhen consciousness enters an individual\u0026rsquo;s reality, this life begins a relatively fixed journey of life. Although we feel that we have free will and can choose our direction and thoughts, there are actually many invisible restrictions around us.\nFor example, when a baby first comes into this world, it cannot walk, talk, or even crawl, and can only lie in the crib. In theory, it may try to crawl to the edge of the bed and try to crawl out, but that is extremely limited \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo;.\nStart We could assume that consciousness \u0026ldquo;activates\u0026rdquo; at some point early in life. For some people, this may happen in the womb; for others, it may be after birth. For most people, consciousness is unstable at first, and it may enter and leave the body from time to time until it finally stabilizes and truly integrates into this reality.\nIf we draw this process on a world line diagram, it is \u0026ldquo;falling into\u0026rdquo; the world line template map.\nThe first few minutes In the first few minutes, days, and months, freedom of movement is very limited. The consciousness is still learning how to move, learning how to use the body. So the actual physical activity it can do is limited.\nHowever, if it pushed itself, and it strove to overcome, it could roll, crawl, move and do other things that are very difficult to do. These difficult things can be defined as hills and mountains on the template map. Using the Z-axis, the higher the “mountain”, the harder the effort. The shallower the depression, the easier the effort.\nOver time, consciousness moves on this template map.\nDepending on the personality of consciousness, it either chooses the easy route or it becomes a \u0026ldquo;tough guy\u0026rdquo; and pushes forward, striving to \u0026ldquo;climb those mountains.\u0026rdquo;\nWe can conclude that before birth, everyone corresponds to a preset \u0026ldquo;world line template\u0026rdquo;. This template largely determines the direction of your future development. Therefore, if you do nothing and live your life naturally, your future will be roughly predictable without much deviation.\nBut, if you decide to climb “those hills and mountains”, what then?\nKey Point The height of the \u0026ldquo;mountain\u0026rdquo; is a measure of effort and deviation from the comfortable norm of the consciousness\u0026rsquo;s pre-birth worldline template. When consciousness leaves the \u0026ldquo;flat, safe\u0026rdquo; median, it will change, but the change will not be great.\nThat is, the pre-birth worldline template will still remain pretty much the same. The consciousness will \u0026ldquo;climb that mountain\u0026rdquo; and then discover other areas that were originally forbidden to it, i.e., possibilities that were originally unreachable.\nFrom the above inferences, it can be concluded that the location of entry into the template is very critical, which will determine how much effort the consciousness needs to put in to reach where they want to go.\nGlossary Time In the MWI, consciousness is constantly moving between worldlines, so what we call \u0026ldquo;time\u0026rdquo; is actually the experience and process of consciousness moving through the MWI.\nTherefore, each consciousness experiences their own version of \u0026ldquo;time\u0026rdquo;, which is determined by the speed at which the consciousness travels between worldlines. A \u0026ldquo;unified\u0026rdquo; time exists within a single worldline, but this is of no help to consciousness.\nLife-Line A “life-line” is a collection of experiences that a consciousness has. As the consciousness moves in and out of individual moments of time, it creates a path. This path looks like a vector. It starts at the moment of birth and ends at the moment of death.\nTime-Line A timeline is a segment of a lifeline. It can be a continuous segment of any lifeline.\nWorld-Line A \u0026ldquo;world line\u0026rdquo; is a frozen moment, like a photograph. It contains its unique history and future. The history and future of each world line are different.\nAs far as using the world-line map template, each intersection point, dot or globe represents one such world-line.\nWorld-Line Cluster If the number of consciousnesses is finite, but the number of worldlines is close to infinite, then the probability that each consciousness has its own worldline is greatest. In other words, shared worldlines are rare.\nHowever, as the consciousness travels on the MWI it does so based upon it’s thoughts. If others share the same thoughts, they travel the MWI in a similar manner.\nIf you map out the Time-Lines of people who are sharing similar thoughts, you will find that they seem to travel together, and they seem to experience the same World-lines. Which known as clustering.\nEcho Chamber In discussions of news media, an echo chamber refers to situations in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system and insulated from rebuttal. By participating in an echo chamber, people are able to seek out information that reinforces their existing views without encountering opposing views, potentially resulting in an unintended exercise in confirmation bias. Echo chambers may increase social and political polarization and extremism. -Wikipedia\nIf you only listen to a certain type of \u0026ldquo;news\u0026rdquo; and only receive opinions from others who agree with you, your thoughts will be reinforced into a set narrative and you will not be able to think other thoughts.\nFrom the perspective of MWI, it is dangerous to be in a closed environment where thoughts are set to \u0026ldquo;be in a rut\u0026rdquo;. It locks you into a path and drives you to a set place in MWI, whether good or bad.\nTemplate Map The template map is a model used to visualize how consciousness moves in MWI. It can be thought of as a topological map, made up of grid intersections, each of which represents a \u0026ldquo;world line\u0026rdquo;.\nThe shape of the map surface reflects the most likely path a consciousness can move through its physical body.\nThe height of the terrain represents the difficulty of movement. Flat areas symbolize easy movement without much effort, while \u0026ldquo;mountains\u0026rdquo; represent extremely high difficulties and challenges.\nPre-Birth World-Line Template Map Refers to the first map that is set when a baby is born and the consciousness is injected into the body. This map is designed before the consciousness enters the material world, and its purpose is to allow the consciousness to experience a specific series of experiences in it. This is a carefully constructed specific life path.\nIn this map, the consciousness will travel along the most convenient path pre-set to experience a series of events.\nThe only way to leave this map is to \u0026ldquo;slide\u0026rdquo; into another completely different template map.\nSlide A slide is an intentional change of the template map. Consciousness “slide” off the map that you are on, and land on a completely different map.\nWhile this can be accomplished through design, the most effective way (on an individual basis) is to do it through thinking. By specifically controlling your thoughts to slide out of the template map, sliding to the template that is next to it, like sliding from one layer of a layer cake to another.\nShadow People Consciousness travels through world lines alone. It is extremely rare for another consciousness to share a world line with us.\nSo for a consciousness, all these \u0026ldquo;people\u0026rdquo; it sees are actually just an empty container. They are real, and they have feelings that we react to, but its consciousness is not there, but on their own world line. This person on all other world lines is just a projection of the main consciousness.\nMountains On the topography of a world-line template are “highs” and “lows”. These features define the difficulty of effort to move in those directions. A “mountain” is a particularly difficult are to traverse. And on the 3D map it will appear as a mountain.\nHills A hill is similar to a mountain. It’s level of difficulty to traverse is proportionally smaller.\nComfort Zone In actual experience, the flat, unruffled areas on the world line template map are the so-called \u0026ldquo;comfort zones\u0026rdquo;. No matter how rugged and steep the terrain ahead looks, there will always be a relatively smooth and easy path in the world line template set before birth.\nThe good thing is that no matter what you face in life, there is always a \u0026ldquo;default route\u0026rdquo; waiting for you to move forward; it may be smooth or difficult, but it always exists.\n","date":"2025-03-18T00:00:00Z","image":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-is-mwi/0008_hu_835c75de7ac85b24.png","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-is-mwi/","title":"What is MWI"},{"content":" Dear User,\nWe regret to inform you that due to domain abuse and other related issues, after extensive discussions with the .KG registry, ccltd.kg will no longer be allowed to receive any complaint reports—otherwise, the .KG registry will permanently disable domain resolution.\nUS.KG Domains: Current Situation\nAlthough US.KG DNS resolution has been temporarily re-enabled, please be aware that if any further complaints are received, the .KG registry will immediately revoke DNS resolution again. This restriction is beyond our control, as it is an official policy of the .KG registry, not a decision made by us.\nAs a result, we are forced to suspend all US.KG domain resolutions, and the ability to register new US.KG domains has been disabled.

They have extraordinary self-confidence and arrogance, look down on everything, are introverted, like to think about problems but often dare not really be independent, their grades cannot crush their classmates, they have not carried out large-scale learning and self-discipline, and their thoughts are not objective, materialistic, and practical. They have no ability to counteract these huge side effects of being an INTJ.\nTransition L-M After experiencing a mental transformation (usually a breakdown and remodeling) caused by long-term thinking, they realize that arrogance and coldness are not conducive to achieving their goals, so they try to become more humble and use personality masks. As they gradually have a concept of their goals and the path in between, INTJs at this stage will improve their ability to act and their thirst for knowledge.\nMiddle stage A middle stage INTJ possesses high intelligence, deep philosophical thinking, and strong self-discipline. They can analyze most things clearly and independently resolve various peculiar thoughts. Having dedicated thousands or even tens of thousands of hours to learning, they have developed exceptional decision-making, judgment, and perception through extensive reading, far surpassing the accuracy of ordinary individuals. Their academic performance and achievements exceed those of most peers. Becoming more social and communicative, fearless in standing out, and establish rules and order for their teams. Able to control time and energy in certain extent.\nTransition M-H This stage has approached or achieved success in a secular sense, and after several years of development, has made outstanding contributions or achievements in a specific field. Gradually, they have acquired high-level rationality and the ability to predict the times, breaking free from the limitations of emotional and physical basic feedback.\nHigher stage Higher stage INTJs are built on top rationality, understand the laws of the world, have accurate long-term prediction capabilities, learning abilities, and terrifying execution capabilities. High stage INTJs are only limited by their physical and time limits, so they usually reach the pinnacle in a field, can thoroughly study the things they love and influence others, can soar to the sky in good times, and can turn the tide in bad times. They dare to be unique and are not afraid of power.\n\u0026ldquo;置之死地而后生\u0026rdquo; People like and admire INTJs, but only high-level INTJs. Their decisiveness, perseverance, and courage are highly praised, and their near-absolute rationality is called a miracle. However, the more perfect these abilities are, the deeper the gap between the middle and high levels is. The M-H stage will be a hurdle that most people will never be able to cross in their lifetime, and it is also the stage that only a few top entrepreneurs, politicians, and financial tycoons can overcome.\nINTJ\u0026rsquo;s aversion to stupidity and their own arrogance make them more accepted by society the higher they are. For lower- and middle-stage INTJs, accepting the reality of being weak, being open-minded and objective, studying as diligently as possible, and always being optimistic are the only ways to reach a higher level.\nInteresting vs. Meaningful External rules and influences INTJ\u0026rsquo;s instinct is to pursue efficiency. If they don\u0026rsquo;t see the meaning of something, they won\u0026rsquo;t even take a second look at it in order to \u0026ldquo;maximize efficiency.\u0026rdquo; However, what many people think of as \u0026ldquo;meaningful\u0026rdquo; is actually based on external rules, such as getting into a good school, finding a good job, and winning social recognition. These are value systems defined by others, and are \u0026ldquo;finite games\u0026rdquo; that will eventually fall into endless competition.\nFinite games vs. infinite games The goal of a finite game is to win, so the rules are clear and there are many competitors, leading to involution. The goal of an infinite game is to continue and explore, and the rules can be created, so the competitive pressure is much smaller. INTJs have the advantages of systematic thinking and strategic planning, and can completely choose not to get involved in the established track, but to establish their own game rules, enter the “wilderness”, and open up their own path.\nFind something that is truly “interesting” INTJs tend to execute efficiently, but their thinking framework is often driven by external goals, which easily leads to them just optimizing the existing system and ignoring the possibility of creating a new system. To find something “interesting”, the key is to slow down, return to life, and observe which things can make you invest in it for a long time even without external rewards. In other words, if something doesn\u0026rsquo;t need external recognition and you\u0026rsquo;re still willing to work on it, then it may be worth pursuing.\nThe value of time For INTJs, time is the most valuable resource. The real strategy is not to fight for a tiny advantage in a highly competitive race, but to find areas that have not yet been noticed by the mainstream, set your own rules there, and become a rule maker rather than a passive player in the game. This not only improves the return on investment (ROI), but also conforms to INTJ\u0026rsquo;s long-term planning mindset.\nSupplement In business, breadth is a cost, and depth is a profit. For INTJs, the requirements are even more stringent. They must be both generalists and experts, understand all walks of life, and be the best in their own profession. This puts a double test on time and body, which is one of the reasons why top successful people are so rare.\n","date":"2025-03-04T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intj-born-achiever-and-loser/","title":"INTJ: Born Achiever and Loser"},{"content":"Overview This is an interesting speculation.\nIf AGI/ASI is truly one of the biggest changes in human history, then it’s important to know the worst-case scenario.

Humans retain only symbolic decision-making power. 2031-2035: ASI achieves breakthroughs, taking over strategic decision-making. Corporate CEOs become mere \u0026ldquo;AI interpreters.\u0026rdquo; 2036-2045: Human-machine integration becomes essential for survival. Those without neural implants are marginalized. Consciousness uploading becomes the new class divide. Social Stratification Ruling Class (0.01%): Controls computing power, engages in genetic optimization, and profits from time differentials. Technical Class (9.99%): Maintains human-machine interactions, optimizes data value, and exploits AI vulnerabilities. Disposable Class (90%): Provides data, virtual labor, or serves as \u0026ldquo;biological containers\u0026rdquo; for consciousness uploads. Control Over Key Resources Computing power is monopolized by oligarchs, capable of instantly wiping out dissenters\u0026rsquo; assets. Data becomes the new form of enslavement—ordinary individuals generate data but cannot profit from it.

When this gap is infinitely magnified by multiple parameters, from the perspective of Bayesian probability, the simple model is either directly rejected, but as long as it can roughly match the experimental data, it is better than the complex model.\nThis includes 2 parts:\nOccam\u0026rsquo;s Razor and Bayesianism Occam\u0026rsquo;s Razor and Bayesianism are two important principles in reasoning and scientific philosophy. Occam’s Razor emphasizes simplicity, favoring explanations that introduce the fewest unnecessary assumptions. Bayesianism, on the other hand, focuses on probabilistic reasoning, continuously updating our beliefs based on new evidence.\nOccam’s Razor: Favoring Simpler Explanations Occam’s Razor states that when multiple explanations exist, the simplest one is usually the best. This idea was introduced by the 14th-century philosopher William of Ockham, who argued that we should avoid unnecessary complexity in our reasoning.\nFor example, if a strange noise is heard at night, one could assume either:\nIt was caused by the wind. It was caused by ghosts moving objects around the house. Occam’s Razor suggests choosing the first explanation because it relies on well-understood natural causes rather than introducing additional, unproven assumptions. While simplicity alone does not guarantee correctness, it often leads to more practical and testable theories.\nBayesianism: Updating Beliefs Based on Evidence Bayesianism is a way of reasoning that helps us refine our beliefs as we gather more information. Instead of treating ideas as either absolutely true or false, it considers different possibilities and adjusts how likely each one is based on new evidence.\nFor instance, if a doctor suspects a patient has a certain illness, they do not immediately confirm it. Instead, they look at symptoms, test results, and medical history, gradually becoming more confident in a diagnosis as more information is gathered.\nIf new evidence contradicts the initial assumption, the doctor revises their belief and considers other possibilities.\nThis method is widely used in fields such as science, machine learning, and even everyday decision-making. It allows us to make better predictions and avoid jumping to conclusions too quickly.\nThe Relationship Between O. and B. More complex explanations usually have lower initial credibility. When we lack strong evidence, it makes sense to assume simpler explanations are more likely, aligning with Occam’s Razor. Bayesian reasoning naturally favors simpler theories unless the evidence strongly supports a more complex one. If two explanations fit the data equally well, the simpler one is usually more likely to be correct.

During this period, the global economy has undergone an evolution from post-war reconstruction, technological innovation, market-oriented reforms to informatization and globalization.\n1. 1950s: Postwar reconstruction and economic prosperity After the end of World War II, the world entered a period of post-war reconstruction. The economies of Western Europe and Japan recovered rapidly, and the United States became the global economic leader.\n2. 1960s: Technological innovation and social change Technological advances (such as computers and aerospace) and social movements (such as the civil rights movement and the counterculture) flourished.\n3. 1970s: Oil crisis and economic stagflation The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) imposed an oil embargo, causing oil prices to soar and triggering global economic stagflation (high inflation and high unemployment coexisting). Two oil shocks in 1973 and 1979 led to a slowdown in global economic growth.\n4. 1980s: Market-oriented reforms and globalization Many countries have implemented market-oriented reforms and liberalization policies, and the process of globalization has accelerated.\n5. 1990s: Information technology revolution and economic prosperity The information technology (IT) revolution has driven global economic growth, and the Internet and digital transformation have become mainstream. The Asian financial crisis in 1997 had an impact on emerging market countries, but the global economy generally maintained growth.\n6. 2000s: Global financial crisis and economic adjustment IT exploded in developing countries, and the global financial market became highly integrated. The Internet winter in 2001 and the global financial crisis in 2008 led to a global economic recession.\n7. 2010s: Post-crisis era and the rise of emerging markets Countries implemented stimulus policies, and the global economy gradually recovered.

Happy new year to you all guys!\nToday\u0026rsquo;s electronic products are thinner and lighter than before, but they are still very heavy, especially those laptops with good performance that weigh more than one kilogram. Today’s quantum computers are larger and heavier than traditional computers—they are housed in specific rooms and run.\nThis prompts us to ask: what kinds of products could define the future? Can we experience the same level of excitement as we did with groundbreaking releases like the MacBook or the iPhone X?\nOne promising candidate is AR glasses powered by directional beam charging technology. Currently, most AR glasses fail to replace smartphones, primarily due to their weight, with bulky batteries being the main culprit. Since this, if we can cancel the battery and use a power bank to charge, also replace the wire to wireless RF (radio frequency) technology, such as millimeter-wave directional transmission, all above problems will be solved.\nThe biggest challenges are: heating problem, high energy consumption ratio chip and High-resolution transparent display.\nThe same technology has the potential to revolutionize aerospace. Traditional space elevators are constrained by material limitations. By eliminating these materials and instead using ion thrusters with vector control to maintain a fixed orbit, coupled with wireless RF technology for power transmission, we could bypass these constraints entirely.\nThis would pave the way for a low-Earth orbit transportation method far more efficient than traditional rockets.\nThe future of technology is brimming with possibilities, although we feel like the technological progress has gradually slowed down or even stalled, but in fact there are still many conceptual technologies that have not been widely used.\n","date":"2025-01-03T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/future/","title":"Future"},{"content":"Overview Original Post:\nFlow X13 RTX4060 Timespy World Record (No Modification) : r/FlowX13\nRevitalize Your Flow X13 in 2025: $0 Cost Performance Boost : r/FlowX13\nDevice ROG Flow X13 2023 RTX 4060 RAM, vRAM 16G, 8G Hardware Modification No Driver 555.97 Power Original 130W vBIOS DELL RTX4060 Full Power 140W Additional heat sink NO Ambient temperature -12℃ / 10.4℉ Highest Timespy Score 10376 Highest Graphic Score 10536 Result Summary Since Timespy prefers GPU scores, limiting CPU power consumption and increasing GPU clock frequency as much as possible successfully allows Flow X13 to compete head-on with gaming laptops that are twice as heavy as it. In comparison, the Timespy score of a 110W RTX4060 gaming laptop is 10500.\nBefore the release of Flow X13, I wanted to achieve a Timespy score of more than 10000 at a weight of 1.3kg, and Flow X13 gave me this possibility.\nThe symbolism of this record is far greater than its practicality, because you obviously can\u0026rsquo;t always use a laptop in the Arctic, and the CPU will compete with the GPU for power consumption. But I think this is the direction of future electronic products, extreme compactness and extreme performance.\nBut why is there no Flow disclosure in 2025? Is it going to be released in the middle of the year?\nI hope this experiment can help all Flow X13 users.\nFor the theoretical part, please see this post: Revitalize Your Flow X13 in 2025: $0 Cost Performance Boost : r/FlowX13\nvBIOS: VGA Bios Collection: Dell RTX 4060 Mobile 8 GB | TechPowerUp\nHow To Improve Performance WARNING: The tutorial has certain risks, please see the end of the article.\nOverview Today is the first day of 2025, I wish you all a happy new year.\nBefore CES 2025, I am sure that Flow X13 2023 will still be the only one of its size, because the 60Hz screen of PX13 is really not flattering.\nFlow X13 balances everything: battery life, screen, CPU, graphics card, weight\u0026hellip; Despite this, it is still difficult to compete with traditional gaming laptops due to its size.\nHowever, with the release of many laptops in 2023 and 2024, it has become a reality for Flow X13 to achieve the default performance of gaming laptops. Today, the performance of the RTX4060 version will be very close to the level of access to XG Mobile RTX3070 (or even XG Mobile RTX3080).\nHow The following examples are all based on the RTX4060 version.\nThrough testing, we can know that the power consumption allocation of Flow X13 is 20wCPU+50wGPU. At this time, the core temperature is kept about 80℃, which means that the scheduling is very conservative, so the primary goal is to use up all cooling redundancy. At this time, the maximum GPU frequency is only 1800MHz.\nBy flashing vBIOS, you can change the graphics card power consumption and scheduling strategy. Please Google how to flash vBIOS, I will not repeat it here. If you encounter green screen or blue screen problems, please try to change the nvflash version and avoid using GPU-Z to back up your vBIOS.\nFlashing vBIOS is risky, please make sure:\n1. Back up the original vBIOS file\n2. The GPU mode is Hybrid Output Mode (cGPU+dGPU) when flashing\n3. The flashed vBIOS is safe and supports Dedicated GPU Direct Output Mode and Hybrid Output Mode, otherwise your computer might become a paperweight\n4. vBIOS Device ID is \u0026ldquo;10DE 28E0\u0026rdquo; (Check your original device ID and choose vBIOS with same ID)\n5. Reinstall the correct driver\nWhere A few tested vBIOS to choose from:\nAlienware RTX 4060 vBIOS (TGP 70~75W) VGA Bios Collection: Alienware RTX 4060 Mobile 8 GB | TechPowerUp\nLenovo RTX 4060 vBIOS (TGP 80~85W) VGA Bios Collection: Lenovo RTX 4060 Mobile 8 GB | TechPowerUp\nNot recommended but optional: (Exceeding thermal limits)\nLenovo RTX 4060 vBIOS (TGP 90~100W) VGA Bios Collection: Lenovo RTX 4060 Mobile 8 GB | TechPowerUp\nHow to configure G-Helper Firstly, I used the vBIOS of the 70W Alienware X14R2 (VGA Bios Collection: Alienware RTX 4060 Mobile 8 GB | TechPowerUp) to adjust the GPU Clock Limit through G-helper and drew the energy efficiency curve of the Flow X13 4060M graphics card:\nAlso as we all know, the power consumption and frequency of RTX 4060 Mobile are closely related:\nRTX 4060 Mobile 80W 1545-1890 MHz RTX 4060 Mobile 90W 1620-2010 MHz RTX 4060 Mobile 105W 2115-2250 MHz RTX 4060 Mobile 115W 2295-2370 MHz From the figure, we can see that the CPU has the best performance when limited to 60 watts, and overclocking the graphics card will reduce some CPU performance. This is because the total power consumption is limited to ~125W.\nIn summary, you can save power by limiting the graphics card clock frequency and confirm its performance according to the table, while limiting the CPU to 60W can maximize utilization.\nResults The computer has not undergone any hardware modification, the test date is January 1, 2025, 130W original power supply, and the driver version is 555.97. The test environment is room temperature 20~25 ℃, and the computer is placed on a laptop stand to raise it.\nSummary In comparison, the Flow X13 4070\u0026rsquo;s Timespy score is up to 9440, with a CPU score of 10681 and a GPU score of 9251. The maximum speed of Flow X13 factory vBIOS is 8800, so you can get at least 10% performance improvement for free by using this method.\nBut is this really the limit?\nWarning Ensure cooling redundancy!\nPushing a GPU beyond its design limits significantly stresses the VRM, particularly the high-side FETs, increasing the risk of failure. GPU core failures in laptops are rarely caused by core VRM issues. Instead, failures often stem from the vRAM VRM impacting the core or, more commonly, from CPU VRM failures.\nEven though this post is intended to improve performance without any modifications, to mitigate this situation, I strongly recommend upgrading to high-performance thermal putty, shim components, or improve thermal contact with the bottom panel.\nWhen improving the bottom panel contact make sure you use an additional heat sink to remove the heat from the baseplate. If you don\u0026rsquo;t do this then this modification will have little effect other than making the baseplate hotter.\nAfter testing, when the Timespy score of the unmodified Flow X13 was 10,000 points (±100), the stress test stability was only 90%.\n","date":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/flow-x13-timespy-world-record/WR_1_hu_1fb79e6602887ac0.png","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/flow-x13-timespy-world-record/","title":"Flow X13 Timespy World Record"},{"content":"Per Aspera Ad Astra, which refers \u0026ldquo;Through suffering to the stars\u0026rdquo;.

I find that many times I can’t start something because there is so much resistance that stops me. Since this I decided to find reasons out and trying to avoid it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m curious that where is the resistance comes from, and why it appears. Instead, I find following majority reasons, and I listed some solutions or examples I had now.\nFear Fear is considered to be a survival instinct of human beings since ancient times. This instinct could help to protect individuals when they see the unknow beast, and they will run away.\nSame as the modern people, when individuals meets a unknow thing, they will instinctively flee rather than fight.\nSolution: Break down the target into small steps, see what needs to be done in each step (for example, writing an article requires different paragraphs), and make an outline to know everything you need to do. Sometimes a long outline itself can cause fear, so start by focusing on a specific section and giving it a suitable deadline is a good choice. Although deadlines are the first productivity, overly strict deadlines can cause fear and prevent from taking actions. Deadline can be brought forward after the start (e.g. to cut the time in half to improve efficiency), but it cannot be postponed.\nIf the above doesn't work, it means the subdivisions are not simple enough. So try to repeat the above steps for each subdivitions until they do not cause any stress or burden.\nFor tasks with a fixed deadline, try to at least cut the time in half to be more efficient. If the fixed deadline itself is difficult to accomplish, try to start working on it once everything are listed.\nRisk, cost and benefits are not equal, or unpredictable Almost all things have their corresponding sacrifice. Usually time, money, and energy. All things and experience are exchanging between the individual and the world, use currencies above.\nPeople are forced to pay something so most of them couldn\u0026rsquo;t accept failure. If they fail, they lose all the stuff they invested. For most people, the benefits are limited, but everything they put in makes them feel physically or psychologically uncomfortable.\nBecause of this, people tend to choose stop, or even avoid to start due trying to avoid predictable risks, which is a part of the survival instinct.\nFor most things, the total amount of things completed remains the same, the time is reduced, and the energy spent is increased. So there is a limit to the sum of time and energy.\nAlthough this sum is limited, the different distribution of the two will greatly affect the ability to act. More energy and shorter time will cause fear, vice versa. This is because compare to the time, energy limit is more obvious and easier to feel. Less time also refers to have less time to resolve unexpected issues, which stands for bigger risks.\nSolution: Give a looser deadline at the beginning to reduce fear, move deadline forward after start to increase efficiency.\nFor those things doesn't have high benefits relatively, find out its urgency and significance to replace the benefits part. If none of the above is true, avoid doing this useless thing.\nUnclear direction Some individuals may have a big goal but many without details. Not enough details refers unknow, which means fear.\nInstead, unclear direction will stop people to trying to start because they don\u0026rsquo;t know where and how to start.\nSolution: Break things down into enough detail and make an outline so you know what needs to be done and how to get started.\nFor unknown parts, search to obtain content and solutions, calculating impacts.\nNot interesting The brain likes interesting things and dislikes boring things. When people have more interesting options, the brain will try to choose the interesting thing that is useless, rather than the useful but boring thing.\nMany things are indeed useful, but the way they are done is boring, so psychological resistance will be generated to try to prevent them.\nSolution: Find a more interesting way to finish the thing.\nIf the most efficient way to do the thing is not interesting, reduce relative fun. For example, reduce entertainment or ban cell phones (Reduce activities that are considered the most interesting to narrow the gap between the fun of doing serious work and entertainment. A smaller gap will produce less resistance when doing serious work).\nAll above can be summed up in one sentence:\u0026quot;Make the life pure.\u0026quot;\nConclusion 4 Majority reasons: Fear, Risk, cost and benefits are not equal, or unpredictable, Unclear direction, Not interesting.\nSolutions:\n1. Break down the goal and form the outline.\n2. Give a looser deadline at the beginning to reduce fear, move deadline forward after start to increase efficiency.\n3. Avoid doing useless thing.\n4. Searching for unknow parts of plan and fill out the outline.\n5. Find a more interesting way to finish the thing.\n6. Reduce relative fun and make the life pure.\n","date":"2024-11-18T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-makes-action-hard/","title":"What Makes Action Hard?"},{"content":"When I do some review of my past life, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to find that I spend more time on learning, but not applying.

As a result, over many generations, they will be more and more individuals with that inherited alliance. These individuals form a population better suitable to the environment. Speciation During speciation, a new species is formed from existing population As natural selection occurs, populations can diverge from each other to such a extent that they create a new species.

Incoming short wave solar radiation is reflected and absorbed to various degrees\n44. Albedo\nDescribes the amount of radiation reflected by earth surface Low Albedo-Absorb more radiation High Albedo-Reflect more radiation\n45. Atmospheric Pressure\nAtmospheric pressure is a pressure exerted by mass of air above any point on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface\n46. Barometer\nUsed to measure atmospheric pressure in kilopascals (kpa) The flexible metal capsule in the barometer expands and contracts as air pressure changes.\n47. Altitude and pressure\nAs the altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases\n48. Temperature and pressure\nWarm air is less dens than cold air, resulting in lower atmospheric pressure\n49. Humidity\nMeasurement describes the amount of water vapor in the air Greater humidity cause lower atmospheric pressure\n49. Air mass\nA mass of air with similar temperature and humidity throughout an area When cool air forms over a cool region a high pressure system forms\n50. Front\nA boundary between two air masses\n51. Weather\nA condition of the atmosphere in a specific place and a specific time Temperature, Atmospheric pressure, Humidity, Wind speed and direction Closely connected to heat transfer in the atmosphere\n52. Tornado\nViolent funnel-shaped column High-altitude meets large thunderstorm When warm, moist air rises into the atmosphere, rain is produced and heat energy is released Warm air rushes into the atmosphere, displacing cool air, creating the Coriolis effect\n53. Wind\nMovement of air from high pressure area to low pressure area. Geographic features such as mountains, oceans, and lakes greatly affect the characteristics of local winds\n54. Prevailing Winds\nTypical winds for a certain region\n55. Coriolis Effect\nChange in direction of moving air, water or objects due to the earths rotation Coriolis effect and convection results in three major global wind systems Trade winds, Prevailing Westerlies, Polar Easterlies\nPart IV - 3.32 Natural Causes of Climate Change 56. Climate\nDescribes the average conditions of the atmosphere in a region over 30 years or more Includes Clouds, Precipitation, Average Temperature, Humidity, Atmospheric Pressure, Solar Radiation, and Winds Climate can refer to a region as small as an island or as large as a planet\n57. Biogeoclimatic Zones\nA region with a certain type of plant life, soil geography and climate 14 zones in BC\n58. Climate Change\nClimate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns Natural causes-Greenhouse Gases, Volcanic Eruptions, Earth\u0026rsquo;s Orbital Changes, Earth\u0026rsquo;s tilt Changes, Ocean Currents Human causes-Burning of Fossil Fuels, Agriculture, Use of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) Effect redistribution of thermal energy around the world\n59. Paleoclimatologist\nStudy fossils and sediments or gather information about glaciers to help them understand climate change\n60. Ice cores\nSamples taken help us determine what types and amount of gases existed in the atmosphere when the ice was formed By reviewing CO2 data scientists can estimate the climate for the last 650,000 years\n60. Affect Climate Change\nGreenhouse Gases-In the atmosphere absorb and emit solar radiation as thermal energy, increasing Earth\u0026rsquo;s temperature $$ ↑Greenhouse{ }Gases↑Temperature $$ Earth tilt, axis of rotation and orbit around the Sun-Earth experiences seasonal changes due to a combination of its tilt and orbit. When the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotation angle is between 22.1 and 24.5, the Earth\u0026rsquo;s tilt is greatest, changing the angle of the incidence\n61. Carbon Cycle\nThe carbon cycle maintains the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is an important greenhouse gas\n62. Carbon Sinks\nDeep ocean shelled organism, forest, removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere Carbon is converted to carbohydrates in shells of many shelled organisms\n63. Carbon Sources\nWeathering and decaying vegetation add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere\n64. Catastrophic Events\nLarge disasters such as volcanic eruptions and meteorite impacts can send dust, debris and gases into the atmosphere, which reflect and absorb solar radiation, causing the Earth to cool.\n65. Water Cycle (C.P.E.T)\nCirculation of water on, above and under the earth surface\nCondensation-As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it gains gravitational potential energy. It also releases thermal energy to air molecules through collisions. It then cools, condenses around particles in the atmosphere and form clouds. The condensation process more thermal energy to the atmosphere. Precipitation- The water returns to Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface through precipitation when it rains or snows, as the precipitation falls, its gravitational potential energy is transformed into mechanical kinetic energy. This transformation continues as water flows from higher to lower level on the land. Thermal energy is also transferred to the atmosphere through friction as precipitation falls. Evaporation- When water absorbs the sun\u0026rsquo;s energy, the molecules begin to move faster as the solar energy is transformed into thermal energy. If enough solar energy is transformed, water evaporates from Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface. It enters the atmosphere as water vapor, bringing the thermal energy with it. Transpiration- In transpiration plants take up water from ground or bodies of water. In the case of aquatic plants and release into the atmosphere as water vapor like evaporation, transpiration moves thermal energy into the atmosphere. High temperature Increase the evaporation of water and capacity of air to hold water vapor. $$ ↑Temperature↑Watervapor↑HoldAbility $$ Captures more thermal energy, causing the temperature to rise further\n66. Ocean Currents\nThe sinking and rising of deep ocean water creates convection currents that act as a global conveyor belt, transporting water and thermal energy around the Earth\n67. El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\nEl Niño-Weaken trade winds, warm water move eastward. Canada \u0026amp; northern U.S. warmer and dryer La Niña-Stronger trade wind, warm water pushed back to Asia, cool water rises.

Solar Energy Created by Sun Gravitational Potential Energy Created by earth Nuclear Energy Found in nucleus\n75. Solar Energy\nSolar energy drives the water cycle and sustains life on the Earth by providing energy for photosynthesis Solar energy made up by electromagnetic radiation of different wavelengths.\tThese waves transformed into thermal energy when they interact with matter.\tAbout half of this energy enters the Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere, while visible light tends to pass through the atmosphere and reach the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface unchanged. When it reaches the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface, it is converted into thermal energy. It is then radiated into the surroundings in the form of Infrared radiation. It temporarily transfers part of the energy and heat, which plays an important role in the warming of the atmosphere.\n76. Conduction\nAfter land and water absorb solar energy, the molecules collide more frequently with air molecules close to the surface. This collisions transfer thermal energy as a result of temperature of the lower air comes close to the land temperature This triggers convection.\n77. Convection\nConvection occurs as the lower layer of the air warms from conduction $$ AirWarms\\to Expands\\to BecomeLessDense $$ Less dense air rises and cooler, more dense air sinks\n78. Infrared Radiation\nPlay the largest role It helps warm the atmosphere, preventing the Earth from becoming overheated and radiating energy out of the atmosphere\n79. Water Cycle \u0026amp; Cooling Effect\nWater Cycle moderation of earth surface temperature water absorbs a lot of energy when it evaporates. This causes cooling effect\n80. Specific Heat Capacity\nThe amount of energy needed to change the temperature of 1g of a substance 1℃ Earth\u0026rsquo;s vast ocean can store a vast amount of thermal energy with very little change in temperature. Ocean transfer and radiate energy to their colder surroundings. This happened slowly. Without this effect, the Earth would experience radical shifts in temperature between day and night. It would also be much hotter in the summer and much colder in the winter.\n","date":"2024-08-03T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/bc-g10-science-physics-unit-review-sheet/","title":"BC G10 Science Physics Unit Review Sheet"},{"content":" If there are other civilizations in the universe that are more developed than humans, I think their world must be extremely neat and tidy cities, with sharp buildings, obvious artificial features in landform transformation and various functional areas, and the operation of the city depends on powerful central supercomputer control. Aliens may look special, but they will have a lot of auxiliary equipment on their bodies, their thoughts will be more mature than humans, their logical ability will be stronger, and their emotions will fluctuate less, which is equivalent to the artificial intelligence life form in the human science fiction world. Perhaps these aliens are the silicon-based civilization heritage left behind after the disappearance of the carbon-based civilization of the planet, making these intelligent machines created to serve carbon-based creatures the new heirs of civilization.\nThe reason why alien civilizations can continue to develop must be that they are a race with less internal friction, high teamwork ability, and diverse means of observing the world. Less internal friction means that their civilization will not collapse due to resource competition, teamwork ability means high production efficiency, and diverse means of observing the world means a deeper understanding of the physical rules of the universe, so this is the reason why alien civilizations are more developed than the earth.\nAlien civilizations are definitely not absurd and weird cities, chaotic buildings, and backward and barbaric ideas. Such a population cannot be at the forefront of developed civilizations, but will consume each other in the competition for resources and go to destruction. Savage thoughts also mean increasing the risk of internal friction, becoming the fuse of civilization destruction.\nSome more advanced civilizations may be related to their special environment, with abundant sunshine, vast territory, rich mineral resources, and special metal materials, which means that their energy acquisition methods are easier and more abundant. It is possible that aliens can absorb and store energy themselves, and may convert energy in an efficient way to achieve almost no loss.\nI dare not imagine how fierce it will be in Star Wars when each civilization uses the biggest killer of their planet to launch it on the battlefield, and various aliens divide the work and cooperate in production, defense, confrontation, and plunder. They use various battleship tactics and technology to fight for space resources, and they will also form alliances with neighboring galaxy civilizations to develop resources. It is more likely to form a situation of confrontation between multiple forces, and the battlefield is full of star-shaped battleship wreckage.\nAlthough it is just a restatement of science fiction movies and novels, it is quite interesting :D\n","date":"2024-03-12T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/starfield/","title":"Starfield?"},{"content":"This can be said to be the worst month. Although DSα was good at first, the complexity of the table and the tediousness of the calculations made me spend too much time on this \u0026ldquo;efficiency system\u0026rdquo;, wasting a lot of time without any actual results. The program that automatically calculates time has no practical effect, and I have not found a suitable way to summarize and process the large amount of data generated every day.\nRebuilding DSα on Obsidian has indeed simplified a lot of content, but it still cannot solve the fundamental problem, that is, it is not intuitive enough. The limitations of the table and the disappointing functions of Obsidian mind mapping software forced me to choose other software to build this system.\nCurrently, I am migrating it to Simplemind Pro, a well-rated mind mapping software. The completely free configuration and nodes can free the original content from the table, because the best choice is \u0026ldquo;display everything on a huge plane\u0026rdquo;, what you see is what you get.\n","date":"2024-02-26T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/obsidian-is-not-enough/","title":"Obsidian is Not Enough"},{"content":"Directivity system α has been finalized and archived.

The efficiency research in 2023 has not even made any progress on paper, and the low efficiency is amazing\u0026hellip;\nI plan to combine the methods of summarizing and experimenting in 2022 and 2023 and the latest theoretical results into a system that can promote efficiency improvement.\nThis is the Directivity system.\nIt will be built on Obsidian and combined with a complete knowledge base to form an effective workflow.\nOverview Annual plan for 2024 is created based on [[Directivity system α]] and will be committed to providing goal orientation for the whole year.\nDirectivity System α Long-lasting plan Long-lasting plan is the overall plan, which is a long-term ideal plan and overall goal. Long-lasting plan plans take a certain amount of time to complete because of their long time span.\nAnnual plan Annual plan will provide an index for each year\u0026rsquo;s goals and judge the work status of the whole year based on this.\nMonthly plan/Weekly plan Monthly plan will refine the annual goal arrangement to get monthly and weekly goals.\nDay results Day results As the most basic unit, it no longer uses the planning method, but directly counts the results, which is conducive to the visualization of the results and goal progress.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s NEW Annual plan for 2024 systematizes goals, plans, and results for the first time, making them measurable.\nAnnual plan for 2024 will replace Todo list with Result list, Result list is the result of \u0026ldquo;committed to production\u0026rdquo;, while most Todo lists usually exist separately from the commitment to produce results.\nAnnual plan for 2024 is also the first practice of Directivity system α. This will help you notice the most important results. Then focus on the upcoming time frame.\nMain Theoretical basis: Extremely Efficiency : After a year of research on work efficiency, Paramount efficiency theory has been proven to be the key to efficient work completion. In 2024, Extremely Efficiency will inherit this and use it as a basis for rapid iteration and practice of various theories.\nEndorphins and long-termism: Increase endorphins and reduce dopamine through long-termism and sustainable actions. Physical and mental health is the basis for achieving goals, and long-term persistence in action and maintaining high efficiency can lead to better results and endorphin income.\nResult oriented: One of the biggest changes in 2024 is to change from plan-oriented to result-oriented. Results are evaluated directly by goals, rather than by whether the plan is completed. Result orientation pays more attention to the direct connection between the completed content and the goal, so as to know where you are.\nRapid iteration and experimentalism: Rapid iteration can quickly improve the unreasonable aspects of theory or practice, and quickly improve through continuous trial and error to achieve the final results. experimentalism is the biggest helper when facing unknown theories or events. Many theories are not universal, so it is necessary to build methods and systems that belong only to you.\nFirst principles : First principles thinking helps to find the root of the problem and avoid useless work and superficial solutions.\nFeynman : The Feynman learning method aims to repeat facts and principle knowledge to discover and determine whether the content has been mastered.\nTime Boxing : The Time Boxing working method aims to divide time into small enough bars for allocation and planning\nBuild version TIME TEST Wash10min\nBreakfirst15min\nLunch20min\nDinner30min\nWash10min\n600-730 (1.50H (18bar)) 755-1225 (4.50H (54bar)) 1245-1800 (5.92H (71bar)) 1830-2200 (3.50H (42bar)) 15.42H (185bar)\n600-730 (1.50H (18bar)) 1510-1800 (2.83H (34bar)) 1830-2200 (3.50H (42bar)) 7.83H (94bar) %%\nProgress plan January 8 Holidays×15.42H (8×185bar) 16 Schooldays×7.83H (16×94bar) AvailableTime: 248.64H (2984bar)\nFebruary 10 Holidays×15.42H (10×185bar) 19 Schooldays×7.83H (19×94bar) AvailableTime: 302.97H (3636bar)\nMartch 20 Holidays×15.42H (20×185bar) 11 Schooldays×7.83H (11×94bar) AvailableTime: 394.53H (4737bar)\nApril 10 Holidays×15.42H (10×185bar) 20 Schooldays×7.83H (20×94bar) AvailableTime: 310.8H (3730bar)\nMay 11 Holidays×15.42H (11×185bar) 20 Schooldays×7.83H (20×94bar) AvailableTime: 326.22H (3915bar)\nJune 7 Holidays×15.42H (7×185bar) 9 Holidays×15.42H (9×185bar) 14 Schooldays×7.83H (14×94bar) AvailableTime: 217.56H (2611bar) AvailableTime: 248.4H (2981bar)\nAll: 1831.56H (21983bar) %%\n","date":"2024-01-02T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/directivity-system-%CE%B1/","title":"Directivity System α"}]
