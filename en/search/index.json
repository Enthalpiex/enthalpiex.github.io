[{"content":"Today is the last day of September. Looking back, this month has passed very quickly and I have learned a lot. The most important thing is to establish the White Room system, and thinking about the life.\nAccording to Bayesian theory, life should also consist of prior probability and posterior probability. Being alive and healthy constitutes the prior probability, while thoughts and actions constitute the posterior probability. When all conditions are met, it is the road to victory.\nFor the coming month, I decided to finish my high school physics content and improve my English, everything will be checked on my birthday.\nHappy October!\n","date":"2024-09-30T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/prior-probability-of-life/","title":"Prior Probability of Life"},{"content":"These are things to do next few days:\n0.

Aliens may look special, but they will have a lot of auxiliary equipment on their bodies, their thoughts will be more mature than humans, their logical ability will be stronger, and their emotions will fluctuate less, which is equivalent to the artificial intelligence life form in the human science fiction world. Perhaps these aliens are the silicon-based civilization heritage left behind after the disappearance of the carbon-based civilization of the planet, making these intelligent machines created to serve carbon-based creatures the new heirs of civilization.\nThe reason why alien civilizations can continue to develop must be that they are a race with less internal friction, high teamwork ability, and diverse means of observing the world. Less internal friction means that their civilization will not collapse due to resource competition, teamwork ability means high production efficiency, and diverse means of observing the world means a deeper understanding of the physical rules of the universe, so this is the reason why alien civilizations are more developed than the earth.\nAlien civilizations are definitely not absurd and weird cities, chaotic buildings, and backward and barbaric ideas. Such a population cannot be at the forefront of developed civilizations, but will consume each other in the competition for resources and go to destruction. Savage thoughts also mean increasing the risk of internal friction, becoming the fuse of civilization destruction.\nSome more advanced civilizations may be related to their special environment, with abundant sunshine, vast territory, rich mineral resources, and special metal materials, which means that their energy acquisition methods are easier and more abundant. It is possible that aliens can absorb and store energy themselves, and may convert energy in an efficient way to achieve almost no loss.\nI dare not imagine how fierce it will be in Star Wars when each civilization uses the biggest killer of their planet to launch it on the battlefield, and various aliens divide the work and cooperate in production, defense, confrontation, and plunder. They use various battleship tactics and technology to fight for space resources, and they will also form alliances with neighboring galaxy civilizations to develop resources. It is more likely to form a situation of confrontation between multiple forces, and the battlefield is full of star-shaped battleship wreckage.\nAlthough it is just a restatement of science fiction movies and novels, it is quite interesting :D\n","date":"2024-03-12T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/starfield/","title":"Starfield?"},{"content":"This can be said to be the worst month. Although DSα was good at first, the complexity of the table and the tediousness of the calculations made me spend too much time on this \u0026ldquo;efficiency system\u0026rdquo;, wasting a lot of time without any actual results. The program that automatically calculates time has no practical effect, and I have not found a suitable way to summarize and process the large amount of data generated every day.\nRebuilding DSα on Obsidian has indeed simplified a lot of content, but it still cannot solve the fundamental problem, that is, it is not intuitive enough. The limitations of the table and the disappointing functions of Obsidian mind mapping software forced me to choose other software to build this system.\nCurrently, I am migrating it to Simplemind Pro, a well-rated mind mapping software. The completely free configuration and nodes can free the original content from the table, because the best choice is \u0026ldquo;display everything on a huge plane\u0026rdquo;, what you see is what you get.\n","date":"2024-02-26T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/obsidian-is-not-enough/","title":"Obsidian is not ENOUGH"},{"content":"Directivity system α has been finalized and archived.

The efficiency research in 2023 has not even made any progress on paper, and the low efficiency is amazing\u0026hellip;\nI plan to combine the methods of summarizing and experimenting in 2022 and 2023 and the latest theoretical results into a system that can promote efficiency improvement.\nThis is the Directivity system.\nIt will be built on Obsidian and combined with a complete knowledge base to form an effective workflow.\nOverview Annual plan for 2024 is created based on [[Directivity system α]] and will be committed to providing goal orientation for the whole year.\nDirectivity System α Long-lasting plan Long-lasting plan is the overall plan, which is a long-term ideal plan and overall goal. Long-lasting plan plans take a certain amount of time to complete because of their long time span.\nAnnual plan Annual plan will provide an index for each year\u0026rsquo;s goals and judge the work status of the whole year based on this.\nMonthly plan/Weekly plan Monthly plan will refine the annual goal arrangement to get monthly and weekly goals.\nDay results Day results As the most basic unit, it no longer uses the planning method, but directly counts the results, which is conducive to the visualization of the results and goal progress.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s NEW Annual plan for 2024 systematizes goals, plans, and results for the first time, making them measurable.\nAnnual plan for 2024 will replace Todo list with Result list, Result list is the result of \u0026ldquo;committed to production\u0026rdquo;, while most Todo lists usually exist separately from the commitment to produce results.\nAnnual plan for 2024 is also the first practice of Directivity system α. This will help you notice the most important results. Then focus on the upcoming time frame.\nMain Theoretical basis: Extremely Efficiency : After a year of research on work efficiency, Paramount efficiency theory has been proven to be the key to efficient work completion. In 2024, Extremely Efficiency will inherit this and use it as a basis for rapid iteration and practice of various theories.\nEndorphins and long-termism: Increase endorphins and reduce dopamine through long-termism and sustainable actions. Physical and mental health is the basis for achieving goals, and long-term persistence in action and maintaining high efficiency can lead to better results and endorphin income.\nResult oriented: One of the biggest changes in 2024 is to change from plan-oriented to result-oriented. Results are evaluated directly by goals, rather than by whether the plan is completed. Result orientation pays more attention to the direct connection between the completed content and the goal, so as to know where you are.\nRapid iteration and experimentalism: Rapid iteration can quickly improve the unreasonable aspects of theory or practice, and quickly improve through continuous trial and error to achieve the final results. experimentalism is the biggest helper when facing unknown theories or events. Many theories are not universal, so it is necessary to build methods and systems that belong only to you.\nFirst principles : First principles thinking helps to find the root of the problem and avoid useless work and superficial solutions.\nFeynman : The Feynman learning method aims to repeat facts and principle knowledge to discover and determine whether the content has been mastered.\nTime Boxing : The Time Boxing working method aims to divide time into small enough bars for allocation and planning\nBuild version TIME TEST Wash10min\nBreakfirst15min\nLunch20min\ndinner30min\nWash10min\n600-730 (1.50H (18bar)) 755-1225 (4.50H (54bar)) 1245-1800 (5.92H (71bar)) 1830-2200 (3.50H (42bar)) 15.42H (185bar)\n600-730 (1.50H (18bar)) 1510-1800 (2.83H (34bar)) 1830-2200 (3.50H (42bar)) 7.83H (94bar)\nProgress plan January 8 Holidays×15.42H (8×185bar) 16 Schooldays×7.83H (16×94bar) AvailableTime: 248.64H (2984bar)\nFebruary 10 Holidays×15.42H (10×185bar) 19 Schooldays×7.83H (19×94bar) AvailableTime: 302.97H (3636bar)\nMartch 20 Holidays×15.42H (20×185bar) 11 Schooldays×7.83H (11×94bar) AvailableTime: 394.53H (4737bar)\nApril 10 Holidays×15.42H (10×185bar) 20 Schooldays×7.83H (20×94bar) AvailableTime: 310.8H (3730bar)\nMay 11 Holidays×15.42H (11×185bar) 20 Schooldays×7.83H (20×94bar) AvailableTime: 326.22H (3915bar)\nJune 7 Holidays×15.42H (7×185bar) 9 Holidays×15.42H (9×185bar) 14 Schooldays×7.83H (14×94bar) AvailableTime: 217.56H (2611bar) AvailableTime: 248.4H (2981bar)\nAll: 1831.56H (21983bar)\nJanuary Month Things Time Completion Degree Real Time Real CD Jan.
