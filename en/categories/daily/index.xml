        <description>&lt;p&gt;Per Aspera Ad Astra, which refers &amp;ldquo;Through suffering to the stars&amp;rdquo;. The specific object of suffering here is still a mystery to me, but it may be a little clearer now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite Chinese translation of this sentence is &amp;ldquo;历尽艰辛，终抵群星&amp;rdquo; (After going through all the hardships, one will finally reach the stars). The brilliance of the second half is easy to understand, but the first half is too vague. What is suffering refers to? Make the right choice at the right time, sacrifice the minor to save the major in critical moment, doing things that are useful but painful, or trying to force progress when motivation is weak?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolate pain may be a great method to avoid it influence the motivation and energy, but what’s interesting is that the isolation method itself also consumes energy. Is this a loss-making exercise or a way to save the greater good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I believe that the final answer will be complex, because of this complicated world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Makes Action Hard?</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-makes-action-hard/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-makes-action-hard/</guid>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hard-to-start&#34;&gt;Hard to start?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find that many times I can’t start something because there is so much resistance that stops me. Since this I decided to find reasons out and trying to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m curious that where is the resistance comes from, and why it appears. Instead, I find following majority reasons, and I listed some solutions or examples I had now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fear&#34;&gt;Fear
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear is considered to be a survival instinct of human beings since ancient times. This instinct could help to protect individuals when they see the unknow beast, and they will run away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same as the modern people, when individuals meets a unknow thing, they will instinctively flee rather than fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Break down the target into small steps, see what needs to be done in each step (for example, writing an article requires different paragraphs), and make an outline to know everything you need to do. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sometimes a long outline itself can cause fear, so start by focusing on a specific section and giving it a suitable deadline is a good choice. Although deadlines are the first productivity, overly strict deadlines can cause fear and prevent from taking actions. Deadline can be brought forward after the start (e.g. to cut the time in half to improve efficiency), but it cannot be postponed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;If the above doesn&#39;t work, it means the subdivisions are not simple enough. So try to repeat the above steps for each subdivitions until they do not cause any stress or burden.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For tasks with a fixed deadline, try to at least cut the time in half to be more efficient. If the fixed deadline itself is difficult to accomplish, try to start working on it once everything are listed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;risk-cost-and-benefits-are-not-equal-or-unpredictable&#34;&gt;Risk, cost and benefits are not equal, or unpredictable
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all things have their corresponding sacrifice. Usually time, money, and energy. All things and experience are exchanging between the individual and the world, use currencies above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are forced to pay something so most of them couldn&amp;rsquo;t accept failure. If they fail, they lose all the stuff they invested. For most people, the benefits are limited, but everything they put in makes them feel physically or psychologically uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, people tend to choose stop, or even avoid to start due trying to avoid predictable risks, which is a part of the survival instinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most things, the total amount of things completed remains the same, the time is reduced, and the energy spent is increased. So there is a limit to the sum of time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this sum is limited, the different distribution of the two will greatly affect the ability to act. More energy and shorter time will cause fear, vice versa. This is because compare to the time, energy limit is more obvious and easier to feel. Less time also refers to have less time to resolve unexpected issues, which stands for bigger risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Give a looser deadline at the beginning to reduce fear, move deadline forward after start to increase efficiency.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For those things doesn&#39;t have high benefits relatively, find out its urgency and significance to replace the benefits part. If none of the above is true, avoid doing this useless thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unclear-direction&#34;&gt;Unclear direction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some individuals may have a big goal but many without details. Not enough details refers unknow, which means fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, unclear direction will stop people to trying to start because they don&amp;rsquo;t know where and how to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Break things down into enough detail and make an outline so you know what needs to be done and how to get started.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For unknown parts, search to obtain content and solutions, calculating impacts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-interesting&#34;&gt;Not interesting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain likes interesting things and dislikes boring things. When people have more interesting options, the brain will try to choose the interesting thing that is useless, rather than the useful but boring thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things are indeed useful, but the way they are done is boring, so psychological resistance will be generated to try to prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Find a more interesting way to finish the thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;If the most efficient way to do the thing is not interesting, reduce relative fun. For example, reduce entertainment or ban cell phones (Reduce activities that are considered the most interesting to narrow the gap between the fun of doing serious work and entertainment. A smaller gap will produce less resistance when doing serious work).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;All above can be summed up in one sentence:&amp;quot;Make the life pure.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 Majority reasons: Fear, Risk, cost and benefits are not equal, or unpredictable, Unclear direction, Not interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solutions:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Break down the goal and form the outline.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2. Give a looser deadline at the beginning to reduce fear, move deadline forward after start to increase efficiency.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;3. Avoid doing useless thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;4. Searching for unknow parts of plan and fill out the outline.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;5. Find a more interesting way to finish the thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;6. Reduce relative fun and make the life pure.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Applying and Learning</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/applying-and-learning/</link>

        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/applying-and-learning/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I do some review of my past life, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to find that I spend more time on learning, but not applying. Is this because I&amp;rsquo;m still a student, or I&amp;rsquo;m good at applying? It&amp;rsquo;s hard to find out the answer immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this could state for two possible reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have sort of talent on applying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am lack of applying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same time, I think the question really depends on individual&amp;rsquo;s experiences. Difficulty is a qualitative question rather than a quantitative one. Maybe I can try more practice and applying stuff such as do more projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advance forever. Happy applying!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to advance! Advance regardless any cost and consequences! No matter how difficult it is, no matter how painful the road is, we must move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as the goal is theoretically feasible, we have to push forward with all our strength and believe that it will be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Prior Probability of Life</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/prior-probability-of-life/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/prior-probability-of-life/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of September. Looking back, this month has passed very quickly and I have learned a lot. The most important thing is to establish the White Room system, and thinking about the life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Bayesian theory, life should also consist of prior probability and posterior probability. Being alive and healthy constitutes the prior probability, while thoughts and actions constitute the posterior probability. When all conditions are met, it is the road to victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the coming month, I decided to finish my high school physics content and improve my English, everything will be checked on my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy October!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Time Slice, The beginning of everything</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/time-slice-the-beginning-of-everything/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;一些完美主义和远视主义的思索&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;生活在静好的岁月里，没有人再会去冒险了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我意识到有时我们必须有一份承诺；
让你不要在任何时候退却，放弃，无所适从；
让它像激光一样拨开谜语，指引方向；
永远无法得到过去的时间，因为历史被推着前进。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;光阴轮转，但等到意识到轮转之时便是为之已晚。
落叶归根，但南方的常青树并不会因为秋季落叶。
世界的不完美是留给完美主义者最好的馈赠；
陷入轮回之时，是承诺达成之日。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是一篇故事，从今天开始写的故事；
它将解释我的一切，在哪以及为什么这么做：
让一切变得有趣，欢乐，充满意义。
让回忆成为快乐的事，让体验成为唯一的佐证。
当目标是极致的时候，你不得不将一切推向更高。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是一个四维空间，我是生活在三位切片上的人类。
无论对于文明还是个体，只有从高维思考才能解决那些无法想象，甚至无法提出的问题——但是它们客观存在，造成了不完美。
这是时间切片。
三维世界里可以轻易将立方体展开为1个面的平坦白纸，反之亦然；
三维世界里可以轻易创造莫比乌斯带，将两个完全隔离的二位世界拼接。
在四位世界里，三维的一切相形见绌，因此只要控制时间维度，所有问题都将迎刃而解，原本困难的问题变得轻而易举。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;时间被设置成单向的，红移不会停止，熵增不会结束。
锁死流向的时间大大减少了操作空间，但是它仅仅被锁死了方向，因此通过改变流速和效率依然可以一定上程度进行弥补。
这是时间切片，一种全新的时间管理方式：
它将真正描述这个四维空间。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;让回忆成为享受，而不是遗憾。
唯一的承诺，贯穿整个四维空间：
一定要改变世界，让它变得更好。
财富，知识，能力，让人类更加伟大。
从现在开始，构建属于自己的White Room。&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Starfield?</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/starfield/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/starfield/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just saw an interesting comment on bilibili, the original text is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are other civilizations in the universe that are more developed than humans, I think their world must be extremely neat and tidy cities, with sharp buildings, obvious artificial features in landform transformation and various functional areas, and the operation of the city depends on powerful central supercomputer control. Aliens may look special, but they will have a lot of auxiliary equipment on their bodies, their thoughts will be more mature than humans, their logical ability will be stronger, and their emotions will fluctuate less, which is equivalent to the artificial intelligence life form in the human science fiction world. Perhaps these aliens are the silicon-based civilization heritage left behind after the disappearance of the carbon-based civilization of the planet, making these intelligent machines created to serve carbon-based creatures the new heirs of civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why alien civilizations can continue to develop must be that they are a race with less internal friction, high teamwork ability, and diverse means of observing the world. Less internal friction means that their civilization will not collapse due to resource competition, teamwork ability means high production efficiency, and diverse means of observing the world means a deeper understanding of the physical rules of the universe, so this is the reason why alien civilizations are more developed than the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien civilizations are definitely not absurd and weird cities, chaotic buildings, and backward and barbaric ideas. Such a population cannot be at the forefront of developed civilizations, but will consume each other in the competition for resources and go to destruction. Savage thoughts also mean increasing the risk of internal friction, becoming the fuse of civilization destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more advanced civilizations may be related to their special environment, with abundant sunshine, vast territory, rich mineral resources, and special metal materials, which means that their energy acquisition methods are easier and more abundant. It is possible that aliens can absorb and store energy themselves, and may convert energy in an efficient way to achieve almost no loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dare not imagine how fierce it will be in Star Wars when each civilization uses the biggest killer of their planet to launch it on the battlefield, and various aliens divide the work and cooperate in production, defense, confrontation, and plunder. They use various battleship tactics and technology to fight for space resources, and they will also form alliances with neighboring galaxy civilizations to develop resources. It is more likely to form a situation of confrontation between multiple forces, and the battlefield is full of star-shaped battleship wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is just a restatement of science fiction movies and novels, it is quite interesting :D&lt;/p&gt;
