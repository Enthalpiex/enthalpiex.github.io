        <title>INTJ: Born Achiever and Loser</title>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;pathway-of-an-intj&#34;&gt;Pathway of an INTJ
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;lower-stage&#34;&gt;Lower stage
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lower stage, the INTJ usually presents as a being weaker than ordinary people. They have extraordinary self-confidence and arrogance, look down on everything, are introverted, like to think about problems but often dare not really be independent, their grades cannot crush their classmates, they have not carried out large-scale learning and self-discipline, and their thoughts are not objective, materialistic, and practical. They have no ability to counteract these huge side effects of being an INTJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transition-l-m&#34;&gt;Transition L-M
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After experiencing a mental transformation (usually a breakdown and remodeling) caused by long-term thinking, they realize that arrogance and coldness are not conducive to achieving their goals, so they try to become more humble and use personality masks. As they gradually have a concept of their goals and the path in between, INTJs at this stage will improve their ability to act and their thirst for knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;middle-stage&#34;&gt;Middle stage
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A middle stage INTJ possesses high intelligence, deep philosophical thinking, and strong self-discipline. They can analyze most things clearly and independently resolve various peculiar thoughts. Having dedicated thousands or even tens of thousands of hours to learning, they have developed exceptional decision-making, judgment, and perception through extensive reading, far surpassing the accuracy of ordinary individuals. Their academic performance and achievements exceed those of most peers. Becoming more social and communicative, fearless in standing out, and establish rules and order for their teams. Able to control time and energy in certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transition-m-h&#34;&gt;Transition M-H
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This stage has approached or achieved success in a secular sense, and after several years of development, has made outstanding contributions or achievements in a specific field. Gradually, they have acquired high-level rationality and the ability to predict the times, breaking free from the limitations of emotional and physical basic feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;higher-stage&#34;&gt;Higher stage
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher stage INTJs are built on top rationality, understand the laws of the world, have accurate long-term prediction capabilities, learning abilities, and terrifying execution capabilities. High stage INTJs are only limited by their physical and time limits, so they usually reach the pinnacle in a field, can thoroughly study the things they love and influence others, can soar to the sky in good times, and can turn the tide in bad times. They dare to be unique and are not afraid of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;置之死地而后生&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;置之死地而后生&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People like and admire INTJs, but only high-level INTJs. Their decisiveness, perseverance, and courage are highly praised, and their near-absolute rationality is called a miracle. However, the more perfect these abilities are, the deeper the gap between the middle and high levels is. The M-H stage will be a hurdle that most people will never be able to cross in their lifetime, and it is also the stage that only a few top entrepreneurs, politicians, and financial tycoons can overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INTJ&amp;rsquo;s aversion to stupidity and their own arrogance make them more accepted by society the higher they are. For lower- and middle-stage INTJs, accepting the reality of being weak, being open-minded and objective, studying as diligently as possible, and always being optimistic are the only ways to reach a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interesting-vs-meaningful&#34;&gt;Interesting vs. Meaningful
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;external-rules-and-influences&#34;&gt;External rules and influences
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTJ&amp;rsquo;s instinct is to pursue efficiency. If they don&amp;rsquo;t see the meaning of something, they won&amp;rsquo;t even take a second look at it in order to &amp;ldquo;maximize efficiency.&amp;rdquo; However, what many people think of as &amp;ldquo;meaningful&amp;rdquo; is actually based on external rules, such as getting into a good school, finding a good job, and winning social recognition. These are value systems defined by others, and are &amp;ldquo;finite games&amp;rdquo; that will eventually fall into endless competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;finite-games-vs-infinite-games&#34;&gt;Finite games vs. infinite games
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of a finite game is to win, so the rules are clear and there are many competitors, leading to involution. The goal of an infinite game is to continue and explore, and the rules can be created, so the competitive pressure is much smaller. INTJs have the advantages of systematic thinking and strategic planning, and can completely choose not to get involved in the established track, but to establish their own game rules, enter the “wilderness”, and open up their own path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;find-something-that-is-truly-interesting&#34;&gt;Find something that is truly “interesting”
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTJs tend to execute efficiently, but their thinking framework is often driven by external goals, which easily leads to them just optimizing the existing system and ignoring the possibility of creating a new system. To find something “interesting”, the key is to slow down, return to life, and observe which things can make you invest in it for a long time even without external rewards. In other words, if something doesn&amp;rsquo;t need external recognition and you&amp;rsquo;re still willing to work on it, then it may be worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-value-of-time&#34;&gt;The value of time
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For INTJs, time is the most valuable resource. The real strategy is not to fight for a tiny advantage in a highly competitive race, but to find areas that have not yet been noticed by the mainstream, set your own rules there, and become a rule maker rather than a passive player in the game. This not only improves the return on investment (ROI), but also conforms to INTJ&amp;rsquo;s long-term planning mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;supplement&#34;&gt;Supplement
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In business, breadth is a cost, and depth is a profit. For INTJs, the requirements are even more stringent. They must be both generalists and experts, understand all walks of life, and be the best in their own profession. This puts a double test on time and body, which is one of the reasons why top successful people are so rare.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ASI 2030</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/asi-2030/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/asi-2030/</guid>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If AGI/ASI is truly one of the biggest changes in human history, then I think it’s important to know the worst-case scenario. If they do come to pass, it will be a darker future than Cyberpunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;technology-evolution-timeline&#34;&gt;Technology Evolution Timeline
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025-2030&lt;/strong&gt;: AGI emerges, leading to the large-scale replacement of standardized intellectual work. Humans retain only symbolic decision-making power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2031-2035&lt;/strong&gt;: ASI achieves breakthroughs, taking over strategic decision-making. Corporate CEOs become mere &amp;ldquo;AI interpreters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2036-2045&lt;/strong&gt;: Human-machine integration becomes essential for survival. Those without neural implants are marginalized. Consciousness uploading becomes the new class divide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-stratification&#34;&gt;Social Stratification
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruling Class (0.01%)&lt;/strong&gt;: Controls computing power, engages in genetic optimization, and profits from time differentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Class (9.99%)&lt;/strong&gt;: Maintains human-machine interactions, optimizes data value, and exploits AI vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disposable Class (90%)&lt;/strong&gt;: Provides data, virtual labor, or serves as &amp;ldquo;biological containers&amp;rdquo; for consciousness uploads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;control-over-key-resources&#34;&gt;Control Over Key Resources
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computing power is monopolized by oligarchs, capable of instantly wiping out dissenters&amp;rsquo; assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data becomes the new form of enslavement—ordinary individuals generate data but cannot profit from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time is commodified—the wealthy can store their consciousness, while the poor must sign &amp;ldquo;time debt&amp;rdquo; contracts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;survival-strategies-for-different-groups&#34;&gt;Survival Strategies for Different Groups
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-IQ Individuals&lt;/strong&gt;: Can work as AI thought auditors but must maintain extreme accuracy to avoid surveillance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ordinary White-Collar Workers&lt;/strong&gt;: Limited to AI training-related jobs, facing immediate replacement once AI completes learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Laborers&lt;/strong&gt;: Fully replaced by 2040, surviving only on digital welfare coupons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;impact-of-gender-and-personality&#34;&gt;Impact of Gender and Personality
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women&lt;/strong&gt;: More suitable for training emotional AI models but may face genetic data exploitation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Men&lt;/strong&gt;: Can engage in high-risk AI testing, though at the cost of a significantly shortened lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MBTI Personality Types&lt;/strong&gt;: NT types dominate strategic positions, while SF types become &amp;ldquo;emotional ornaments.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-prediction&#34;&gt;Final Prediction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;2045&lt;/strong&gt;, AI computing power surpasses the singularity threshold, potentially triggering the &amp;ldquo;Earth Formatting Protocol.&amp;rdquo; Those outside the elite circles may be downgraded into a purely virtual existence.&lt;br&gt;
Decisions made before &lt;strong&gt;2030&lt;/strong&gt; will determine the survival conditions of &lt;strong&gt;2045&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be a highly algorithm-driven and computationally dominated future, where social stratification will be even more extreme than it is today. Energy, biotechnology, and AI will all develop rapidly, and the living space of ordinary people will be greatly compressed. From an individual perspective, the only way out is to act quickly and strive for a proactive position before the ASI era arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study and go ahead, as far as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Occam&#39;s Razor and Bayesianism</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/occams-razor-and-bayesianism/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/occams-razor-and-bayesianism/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In simple models and complex models, as long as the simple model is consistent with the results, its confidence is much higher than that of the complex model. When this gap is infinitely magnified by multiple parameters, from the perspective of Bayesian probability, the simple model is either directly rejected, but as long as it can roughly match the experimental data, it is better than the complex model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes 2 parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;occams-razor-and-bayesianism&#34;&gt;Occam&amp;rsquo;s Razor and Bayesianism
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occam&amp;rsquo;s Razor&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Bayesianism&lt;/strong&gt; are two important principles in reasoning and scientific philosophy. Occam’s Razor emphasizes &lt;strong&gt;simplicity&lt;/strong&gt;, favoring explanations that introduce the fewest unnecessary assumptions. Bayesianism, on the other hand, focuses on probabilistic reasoning, continuously updating our beliefs based on new evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;occams-razor-favoring-simpler-explanations&#34;&gt;Occam’s Razor: Favoring Simpler Explanations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occam’s Razor states that &lt;strong&gt;when multiple explanations exist, the simplest one is usually the best&lt;/strong&gt;. This idea was introduced by the 14th-century philosopher &lt;strong&gt;William of Ockham&lt;/strong&gt;, who argued that we should avoid unnecessary complexity in our reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if a strange noise is heard at night, one could assume either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was caused by the wind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was caused by ghosts moving objects around the house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occam’s Razor suggests choosing the first explanation because it relies on well-understood natural causes rather than introducing additional, unproven assumptions. While simplicity alone does not guarantee correctness, it often leads to more practical and testable theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bayesianism-updating-beliefs-based-on-evidence&#34;&gt;Bayesianism: Updating Beliefs Based on Evidence
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayesianism is a way of reasoning that helps us refine our beliefs as we gather more information. Instead of treating ideas as either absolutely true or false, it considers different possibilities and adjusts how likely each one is based on new evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if a doctor suspects a patient has a certain illness, they do not immediately confirm it. Instead, they look at symptoms, test results, and medical history, gradually becoming more confident in a diagnosis as more information is gathered.&lt;br&gt;
If new evidence contradicts the initial assumption, the doctor revises their belief and considers other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is widely used in fields such as science, machine learning, and even everyday decision-making. It allows us to make better predictions and avoid jumping to conclusions too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-relationship-between-o-and-b&#34;&gt;The Relationship Between O. and B.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More complex explanations usually have lower initial credibility.&lt;/strong&gt; When we lack strong evidence, it makes sense to assume simpler explanations are more likely, aligning with Occam’s Razor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bayesian reasoning naturally favors simpler theories unless the evidence strongly supports a more complex one.&lt;/strong&gt; If two explanations fit the data equally well, the simpler one is usually more likely to be correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>World Trends and Crisis Study</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/world-trends-and-crisis-study/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/world-trends-and-crisis-study/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been looking for the future direction recently, so I studied the development of the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1950 to 2025, a significant economic crisis or major economic adjustment occurs approximately every 10 years. During this period, the global economy has undergone an evolution from post-war reconstruction, technological innovation, market-oriented reforms to informatization and globalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-1950s-postwar-reconstruction-and-economic-prosperity&#34;&gt;1. 1950s: Postwar reconstruction and economic prosperity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the end of World War II, the world entered a period of post-war reconstruction. The economies of Western Europe and Japan recovered rapidly, and the United States became the global economic leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-1960s-technological-innovation-and-social-change&#34;&gt;2. 1960s: Technological innovation and social change
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technological advances (such as computers and aerospace) and social movements (such as the civil rights movement and the counterculture) flourished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-1970s-oil-crisis-and-economic-stagflation&#34;&gt;3. 1970s: Oil crisis and economic stagflation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) imposed an oil embargo, causing oil prices to soar and triggering global economic stagflation (high inflation and high unemployment coexisting). Two oil shocks in 1973 and 1979 led to a slowdown in global economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-1980s-market-oriented-reforms-and-globalization&#34;&gt;4. 1980s: Market-oriented reforms and globalization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many countries have implemented market-oriented reforms and liberalization policies, and the process of globalization has accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-1990s-information-technology-revolution-and-economic-prosperity&#34;&gt;5. 1990s: Information technology revolution and economic prosperity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information technology (IT) revolution has driven global economic growth, and the Internet and digital transformation have become mainstream. The Asian financial crisis in 1997 had an impact on emerging market countries, but the global economy generally maintained growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-2000s-global-financial-crisis-and-economic-adjustment&#34;&gt;6. 2000s: Global financial crisis and economic adjustment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT exploded in developing countries, and the global financial market became highly integrated. The Internet winter in 2001 and the global financial crisis in 2008 led to a global economic recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-2010s-post-crisis-era-and-the-rise-of-emerging-markets&#34;&gt;7. 2010s: Post-crisis era and the rise of emerging markets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries implemented stimulus policies, and the global economy gradually recovered. Emerging market countries such as China rose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-2020s-pandemic-and-economic-reconstruction&#34;&gt;8. 2020s: Pandemic and economic reconstruction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a global health crisis, giving rise to remote work and digital transformation. In 2020, the global economy contracted significantly due to the pandemic, and countries subsequently implemented stimulus policies to promote recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Future</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/future/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/future/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s January again! Happy new year to you all guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s electronic products are thinner and lighter than before, but they are still very heavy, especially those laptops with good performance that weigh more than one kilogram. Today’s quantum computers are larger and heavier than traditional computers—they are housed in specific rooms and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prompts us to ask: what kinds of products could define the future? Can we experience the same level of excitement as we did with groundbreaking releases like the MacBook or the iPhone X?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One promising candidate is AR glasses powered by directional beam charging technology. Currently, most AR glasses fail to replace smartphones, primarily due to their weight, with bulky batteries being the main culprit. Since this, if we can cancel the battery and use a power bank to charge, also replace the wire to wireless RF (radio frequency) technology, such as millimeter-wave directional transmission, all above problems will be solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenges are: heating problem, high energy consumption ratio chip and High-resolution transparent display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same technology has the potential to revolutionize aerospace. Traditional space elevators are constrained by material limitations. By eliminating these materials and instead using ion thrusters with vector control to maintain a fixed orbit, coupled with wireless RF technology for power transmission, we could bypass these constraints entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would pave the way for a low-Earth orbit transportation method far more efficient than traditional rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of technology is brimming with possibilities, although we feel like the technological progress has gradually slowed down or even stalled, but in fact there are still many conceptual technologies that have not been widely used.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Per Aspera Ad Astra, which refers &amp;ldquo;Through suffering to the stars&amp;rdquo;. The specific object of suffering here is still a mystery to me, but it may be a little clearer now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite Chinese translation of this sentence is &amp;ldquo;历尽艰辛，终抵群星&amp;rdquo; (After going through all the hardships, one will finally reach the stars). The brilliance of the second half is easy to understand, but the first half is too vague. What is suffering refers to? Make the right choice at the right time, sacrifice the minor to save the major in critical moment, doing things that are useful but painful, or trying to force progress when motivation is weak?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolate pain may be a great method to avoid it influence the motivation and energy, but what’s interesting is that the isolation method itself also consumes energy. Is this a loss-making exercise or a way to save the greater good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I believe that the final answer will be complex, because of this complicated world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Makes Action Hard?</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-makes-action-hard/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-makes-action-hard/</guid>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hard-to-start&#34;&gt;Hard to start?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find that many times I can’t start something because there is so much resistance that stops me. Since this I decided to find reasons out and trying to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m curious that where is the resistance comes from, and why it appears. Instead, I find following majority reasons, and I listed some solutions or examples I had now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fear&#34;&gt;Fear
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear is considered to be a survival instinct of human beings since ancient times. This instinct could help to protect individuals when they see the unknow beast, and they will run away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same as the modern people, when individuals meets a unknow thing, they will instinctively flee rather than fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Break down the target into small steps, see what needs to be done in each step (for example, writing an article requires different paragraphs), and make an outline to know everything you need to do. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sometimes a long outline itself can cause fear, so start by focusing on a specific section and giving it a suitable deadline is a good choice. Although deadlines are the first productivity, overly strict deadlines can cause fear and prevent from taking actions. Deadline can be brought forward after the start (e.g. to cut the time in half to improve efficiency), but it cannot be postponed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;If the above doesn&#39;t work, it means the subdivisions are not simple enough. So try to repeat the above steps for each subdivitions until they do not cause any stress or burden.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For tasks with a fixed deadline, try to at least cut the time in half to be more efficient. If the fixed deadline itself is difficult to accomplish, try to start working on it once everything are listed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;risk-cost-and-benefits-are-not-equal-or-unpredictable&#34;&gt;Risk, cost and benefits are not equal, or unpredictable
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all things have their corresponding sacrifice. Usually time, money, and energy. All things and experience are exchanging between the individual and the world, use currencies above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are forced to pay something so most of them couldn&amp;rsquo;t accept failure. If they fail, they lose all the stuff they invested. For most people, the benefits are limited, but everything they put in makes them feel physically or psychologically uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, people tend to choose stop, or even avoid to start due trying to avoid predictable risks, which is a part of the survival instinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most things, the total amount of things completed remains the same, the time is reduced, and the energy spent is increased. So there is a limit to the sum of time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this sum is limited, the different distribution of the two will greatly affect the ability to act. More energy and shorter time will cause fear, vice versa. This is because compare to the time, energy limit is more obvious and easier to feel. Less time also refers to have less time to resolve unexpected issues, which stands for bigger risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Give a looser deadline at the beginning to reduce fear, move deadline forward after start to increase efficiency.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For those things doesn&#39;t have high benefits relatively, find out its urgency and significance to replace the benefits part. If none of the above is true, avoid doing this useless thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unclear-direction&#34;&gt;Unclear direction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some individuals may have a big goal but many without details. Not enough details refers unknow, which means fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, unclear direction will stop people to trying to start because they don&amp;rsquo;t know where and how to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Break things down into enough detail and make an outline so you know what needs to be done and how to get started.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For unknown parts, search to obtain content and solutions, calculating impacts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-interesting&#34;&gt;Not interesting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain likes interesting things and dislikes boring things. When people have more interesting options, the brain will try to choose the interesting thing that is useless, rather than the useful but boring thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things are indeed useful, but the way they are done is boring, so psychological resistance will be generated to try to prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Find a more interesting way to finish the thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;If the most efficient way to do the thing is not interesting, reduce relative fun. For example, reduce entertainment or ban cell phones (Reduce activities that are considered the most interesting to narrow the gap between the fun of doing serious work and entertainment. A smaller gap will produce less resistance when doing serious work).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;All above can be summed up in one sentence:&amp;quot;Make the life pure.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 Majority reasons: Fear, Risk, cost and benefits are not equal, or unpredictable, Unclear direction, Not interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solutions:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Break down the goal and form the outline.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2. Give a looser deadline at the beginning to reduce fear, move deadline forward after start to increase efficiency.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;3. Avoid doing useless thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;4. Searching for unknow parts of plan and fill out the outline.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;5. Find a more interesting way to finish the thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;6. Reduce relative fun and make the life pure.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Applying and Learning</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/applying-and-learning/</link>

        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/applying-and-learning/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I do some review of my past life, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to find that I spend more time on learning, but not applying. Is this because I&amp;rsquo;m still a student, or I&amp;rsquo;m good at applying? It&amp;rsquo;s hard to find out the answer immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this could state for two possible reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have sort of talent on applying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am lack of applying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same time, I think the question really depends on individual&amp;rsquo;s experiences. Difficulty is a qualitative question rather than a quantitative one. Maybe I can try more practice and applying stuff such as do more projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advance forever. Happy applying!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to advance! Advance regardless any cost and consequences! No matter how difficult it is, no matter how painful the road is, we must move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as the goal is theoretically feasible, we have to push forward with all our strength and believe that it will be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Prior Probability of Life</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/prior-probability-of-life/</link>

        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/prior-probability-of-life/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of September. Looking back, this month has passed very quickly and I have learned a lot. The most important thing is to establish the White Room system, and thinking about the life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Bayesian theory, life should also consist of prior probability and posterior probability. Being alive and healthy constitutes the prior probability, while thoughts and actions constitute the posterior probability. When all conditions are met, it is the road to victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the coming month, I decided to finish my high school physics content and improve my English, everything will be checked on my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy October!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Time Slice, The beginning of everything</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/time-slice-the-beginning-of-everything/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;一些完美主义和远视主义的思索&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;生活在静好的岁月里，没有人再会去冒险了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我意识到有时我们必须有一份承诺；
让你不要在任何时候退却，放弃，无所适从；
让它像激光一样拨开谜语，指引方向；
永远无法得到过去的时间，因为历史被推着前进。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;光阴轮转，但等到意识到轮转之时便是为之已晚。
落叶归根，但南方的常青树并不会因为秋季落叶。
世界的不完美是留给完美主义者最好的馈赠；
陷入轮回之时，是承诺达成之日。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是一篇故事，从今天开始写的故事；
它将解释我的一切，在哪以及为什么这么做：
让一切变得有趣，欢乐，充满意义。
让回忆成为快乐的事，让体验成为唯一的佐证。
当目标是极致的时候，你不得不将一切推向更高。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是一个四维空间，我是生活在三位切片上的人类。
无论对于文明还是个体，只有从高维思考才能解决那些无法想象，甚至无法提出的问题——但是它们客观存在，造成了不完美。
这是时间切片。
三维世界里可以轻易将立方体展开为1个面的平坦白纸，反之亦然；
三维世界里可以轻易创造莫比乌斯带，将两个完全隔离的二位世界拼接。
在四位世界里，三维的一切相形见绌，因此只要控制时间维度，所有问题都将迎刃而解，原本困难的问题变得轻而易举。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;时间被设置成单向的，红移不会停止，熵增不会结束。
锁死流向的时间大大减少了操作空间，但是它仅仅被锁死了方向，因此通过改变流速和效率依然可以一定上程度进行弥补。
这是时间切片，一种全新的时间管理方式：
它将真正描述这个四维空间。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;让回忆成为享受，而不是遗憾。
唯一的承诺，贯穿整个四维空间：
一定要改变世界，让它变得更好。
财富，知识，能力，让人类更加伟大。
从现在开始，构建属于自己的White Room。&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Starfield?</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/starfield/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/starfield/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just saw an interesting comment on bilibili, the original text is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are other civilizations in the universe that are more developed than humans, I think their world must be extremely neat and tidy cities, with sharp buildings, obvious artificial features in landform transformation and various functional areas, and the operation of the city depends on powerful central supercomputer control. Aliens may look special, but they will have a lot of auxiliary equipment on their bodies, their thoughts will be more mature than humans, their logical ability will be stronger, and their emotions will fluctuate less, which is equivalent to the artificial intelligence life form in the human science fiction world. Perhaps these aliens are the silicon-based civilization heritage left behind after the disappearance of the carbon-based civilization of the planet, making these intelligent machines created to serve carbon-based creatures the new heirs of civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why alien civilizations can continue to develop must be that they are a race with less internal friction, high teamwork ability, and diverse means of observing the world. Less internal friction means that their civilization will not collapse due to resource competition, teamwork ability means high production efficiency, and diverse means of observing the world means a deeper understanding of the physical rules of the universe, so this is the reason why alien civilizations are more developed than the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien civilizations are definitely not absurd and weird cities, chaotic buildings, and backward and barbaric ideas. Such a population cannot be at the forefront of developed civilizations, but will consume each other in the competition for resources and go to destruction. Savage thoughts also mean increasing the risk of internal friction, becoming the fuse of civilization destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more advanced civilizations may be related to their special environment, with abundant sunshine, vast territory, rich mineral resources, and special metal materials, which means that their energy acquisition methods are easier and more abundant. It is possible that aliens can absorb and store energy themselves, and may convert energy in an efficient way to achieve almost no loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dare not imagine how fierce it will be in Star Wars when each civilization uses the biggest killer of their planet to launch it on the battlefield, and various aliens divide the work and cooperate in production, defense, confrontation, and plunder. They use various battleship tactics and technology to fight for space resources, and they will also form alliances with neighboring galaxy civilizations to develop resources. It is more likely to form a situation of confrontation between multiple forces, and the battlefield is full of star-shaped battleship wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is just a restatement of science fiction movies and novels, it is quite interesting :D&lt;/p&gt;
