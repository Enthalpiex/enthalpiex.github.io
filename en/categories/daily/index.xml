        <title>The Boring MBTI System</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/the-boring-mbti-system/</link>

        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/the-boring-mbti-system/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be helpful to describe how my attitude towards MBTI has changed over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the MBTI framework offers a compelling way to understand personality patterns, it ultimately simplifies the complexity of human behavior into static categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are dynamic, and their thoughts, actions, and motivations often shift with context, age, and experience. There are also huge differences between people in their ability and degree to control their thoughts. Therefore the binary system created by MBTI is an extremely simplified system that is easy to understand but is not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we must take into account the complexity of the system and try to conduct research in a more fitting way. Classification will inevitably lead to bias, and this bias in the MBTI system has the probability of stereotyping people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limitations of the MBTI are already quite obvious, and it is clear that it constrains many people, both in terms of behavior and potential. I tend to believe that individuals are unique and special, and trying to describe all individuals using 16 types is a very simplified and easy to understand way, which is what makes it so popular, but it does not represent its accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People always want something to be fixed, but reality is often dynamic. It is understandable that seeking to fix reality is a lazy behavior, and this is also true for psychological research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good example of individual peculiarity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Anime Review: Violet Evergarden</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/anime-review-violet-evergarden/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/anime-review-violet-evergarden/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/anime-review-violet-evergarden/VE4.png" alt="Featured image of post Anime Review: Violet Evergarden" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sincerely thank the authors of Kyoto Animation and take this opportunity to remember the lives lost in the fire in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven years later, Violet has become a classic, and she is a well-deserved legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violet is not a real person, but her existence is far more real than many real people. Every time I mention this name, I seem to be standing in front of the red-walled post office that is gradually covered by modern civilization, holding a yellowed letter in my hand, and looking up I can see the half-finished Eiffel Tower and the old times that are gradually fading away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;May your heart be conveyed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Violet&amp;rsquo;s lifelong wish - she wants to be a person who can &amp;ldquo;transmit love.&amp;rdquo; We find it difficult to accept her departure because she is as familiar as a family member, as close as a friend, and as warm as light. We believe that she is the legendary doll who once lived in this world, and appreciate her aristocratic behavior. We are happy that she can use a knife and fork skillfully, sad that she wants to strangle herself when she learns that the major is missing, amazed by her light footsteps on the lake, and moved by her saying without exception that &amp;ldquo;there is no letter that does not need to be delivered&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rarely rate anime characters as &amp;ldquo;great&amp;rdquo;, but Violet is a truly great character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the character who was still accompanying us viewers not long ago, the gentle and powerful, powerful and sad person, is already a century of history. Her story is rarely known, and her figure is already the purple ink on a special stamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her, there is no more Auto-Memory Doll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a legend of the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know this is a fictional story but are unwilling to admit it, we know this is a utopian obsession but are unwilling to give up, just like the line in Violet Evergarden: &amp;ldquo;You know it&amp;rsquo;s not real? But you feel like you are there, sometimes happy, sometimes sad, why? Because you resonate with the protagonist in the story!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memory of civilization is essentially the urns of millions of Violet Evergarden, and we all live in the embers after she burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw Violet holding up an umbrella and becoming the girl stepping lightly on the lake, but we consciously ignored her gorgeous clothes that got soaked a few seconds later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violet is not a god, nor is she a tool, but a person as her name suggests. She turned the burning fire of karma into a mission to convey love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that she is fictional, but we all want to believe that she really existed. We all look forward to walking into that world one day, seeing the cottage by the sea, seeing scattered letters, hearing the sound of typewriters and metal prostheses, and perhaps we will gently say: &amp;ldquo;Thank you, Violet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why she is &amp;ldquo;great&amp;rdquo; is that she represents the ultimate purity of an emotion, a power that still lives towards the light in loss and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can come out of pain and become a more gentle existence; people can learn slowly through letters when they don&amp;rsquo;t know what love is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violet Evergarden, she is not immortal, she is just an ordinary girl who once survived the war, stained with blood but longing for love. But the places she walked, the letters she wrote, and the people she accompanied, are like the traces of stars falling in the night sky. Although short-lived, no one will forget that in that era when people could only communicate through letters, there was an 18-year-old girl who was fulfilling the mission of conveying love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her name is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violet Evergarden&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>INTJ: Born Achiever and Loser</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intj-born-achiever-and-loser/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/intj-born-achiever-and-loser/</guid>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;pathway-of-an-intj&#34;&gt;Pathway of an INTJ
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;lower-stage&#34;&gt;Lower stage
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lower stage, the INTJ usually presents as a being weaker than ordinary people. They have extraordinary self-confidence and arrogance, look down on everything, are introverted, like to think about problems but often dare not really be independent, their grades cannot crush their classmates, they have not carried out large-scale learning and self-discipline, and their thoughts are not objective, materialistic, and practical. They have no ability to counteract these huge side effects of being an INTJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transition-l-m&#34;&gt;Transition L-M
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After experiencing a mental transformation (usually a breakdown and remodeling) caused by long-term thinking, they realize that arrogance and coldness are not conducive to achieving their goals, so they try to become more humble and use personality masks. As they gradually have a concept of their goals and the path in between, INTJs at this stage will improve their ability to act and their thirst for knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;middle-stage&#34;&gt;Middle stage
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A middle stage INTJ possesses high intelligence, deep philosophical thinking, and strong self-discipline. They can analyze most things clearly and independently resolve various peculiar thoughts. Having dedicated thousands or even tens of thousands of hours to learning, they have developed exceptional decision-making, judgment, and perception through extensive reading, far surpassing the accuracy of ordinary individuals. Their academic performance and achievements exceed those of most peers. Becoming more social and communicative, fearless in standing out, and establish rules and order for their teams. Able to control time and energy in certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transition-m-h&#34;&gt;Transition M-H
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This stage has approached or achieved success in a secular sense, and after several years of development, has made outstanding contributions or achievements in a specific field. Gradually, they have acquired high-level rationality and the ability to predict the times, breaking free from the limitations of emotional and physical basic feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;higher-stage&#34;&gt;Higher stage
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher stage INTJs are built on top rationality, understand the laws of the world, have accurate long-term prediction capabilities, learning abilities, and terrifying execution capabilities. High stage INTJs are only limited by their physical and time limits, so they usually reach the pinnacle in a field, can thoroughly study the things they love and influence others, can soar to the sky in good times, and can turn the tide in bad times. They dare to be unique and are not afraid of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;置之死地而后生&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;置之死地而后生&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People like and admire INTJs, but only high-level INTJs. Their decisiveness, perseverance, and courage are highly praised, and their near-absolute rationality is called a miracle. However, the more perfect these abilities are, the deeper the gap between the middle and high levels is. The M-H stage will be a hurdle that most people will never be able to cross in their lifetime, and it is also the stage that only a few top entrepreneurs, politicians, and financial tycoons can overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INTJ&amp;rsquo;s aversion to stupidity and their own arrogance make them more accepted by society the higher they are. For lower- and middle-stage INTJs, accepting the reality of being weak, being open-minded and objective, studying as diligently as possible, and always being optimistic are the only ways to reach a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interesting-vs-meaningful&#34;&gt;Interesting vs. Meaningful
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;external-rules-and-influences&#34;&gt;External rules and influences
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTJ&amp;rsquo;s instinct is to pursue efficiency. If they don&amp;rsquo;t see the meaning of something, they won&amp;rsquo;t even take a second look at it in order to &amp;ldquo;maximize efficiency.&amp;rdquo; However, what many people think of as &amp;ldquo;meaningful&amp;rdquo; is actually based on external rules, such as getting into a good school, finding a good job, and winning social recognition. These are value systems defined by others, and are &amp;ldquo;finite games&amp;rdquo; that will eventually fall into endless competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;finite-games-vs-infinite-games&#34;&gt;Finite games vs. infinite games
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of a finite game is to win, so the rules are clear and there are many competitors, leading to involution. The goal of an infinite game is to continue and explore, and the rules can be created, so the competitive pressure is much smaller. INTJs have the advantages of systematic thinking and strategic planning, and can completely choose not to get involved in the established track, but to establish their own game rules, enter the “wilderness”, and open up their own path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;find-something-that-is-truly-interesting&#34;&gt;Find something that is truly “interesting”
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTJs tend to execute efficiently, but their thinking framework is often driven by external goals, which easily leads to them just optimizing the existing system and ignoring the possibility of creating a new system. To find something “interesting”, the key is to slow down, return to life, and observe which things can make you invest in it for a long time even without external rewards. In other words, if something doesn&amp;rsquo;t need external recognition and you&amp;rsquo;re still willing to work on it, then it may be worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-value-of-time&#34;&gt;The value of time
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For INTJs, time is the most valuable resource. The real strategy is not to fight for a tiny advantage in a highly competitive race, but to find areas that have not yet been noticed by the mainstream, set your own rules there, and become a rule maker rather than a passive player in the game. This not only improves the return on investment (ROI), but also conforms to INTJ&amp;rsquo;s long-term planning mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;supplement&#34;&gt;Supplement
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In business, breadth is a cost, and depth is a profit. For INTJs, the requirements are even more stringent. They must be both generalists and experts, understand all walks of life, and be the best in their own profession. This puts a double test on time and body, which is one of the reasons why top successful people are so rare.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ASI 2030</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/asi-2030/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/asi-2030/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/asi-2030/RSI-NewBabbage.png" alt="Featured image of post ASI 2030" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If AGI/ASI is truly one of the biggest changes in human history, then it’s important to know the worst-case scenario. If they do come to pass, it will be a darker future than Cyberpunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;technology-evolution-timeline&#34;&gt;Technology Evolution Timeline
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025-2030&lt;/strong&gt;: AGI emerges, leading to the large-scale replacement of standardized intellectual work. Humans retain only symbolic decision-making power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2031-2035&lt;/strong&gt;: ASI achieves breakthroughs, taking over strategic decision-making. Corporate CEOs become mere &amp;ldquo;AI interpreters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2036-2045&lt;/strong&gt;: Human-machine integration becomes essential for survival. Those without neural implants are marginalized. Consciousness uploading becomes the new class divide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-stratification&#34;&gt;Social Stratification
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruling Class (0.01%)&lt;/strong&gt;: Controls computing power, engages in genetic optimization, and profits from time differentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Class (9.99%)&lt;/strong&gt;: Maintains human-machine interactions, optimizes data value, and exploits AI vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disposable Class (90%)&lt;/strong&gt;: Provides data, virtual labor, or serves as &amp;ldquo;biological containers&amp;rdquo; for consciousness uploads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;control-over-key-resources&#34;&gt;Control Over Key Resources
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computing power is monopolized by oligarchs, capable of instantly wiping out dissenters&amp;rsquo; assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data becomes the new form of enslavement—ordinary individuals generate data but cannot profit from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time is commodified—the wealthy can store their consciousness, while the poor must sign &amp;ldquo;time debt&amp;rdquo; contracts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-prediction&#34;&gt;Final Prediction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;2045&lt;/strong&gt;, AI computing power surpasses the singularity threshold. Decisions made before 2030 will determine the survival conditions of 2045.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be a highly algorithm-driven and computationally dominated future, where social stratification will be even more extreme than it is today. Energy, biotechnology, and AI will all develop rapidly, and the living space of ordinary people will be greatly compressed. From an individual perspective, the only way out is to act quickly and strive for a proactive position before the ASI era arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously a lot of things need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Occam&#39;s Razor and Bayesianism</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/occams-razor-and-bayesianism/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/occams-razor-and-bayesianism/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In simple models and complex models, as long as the simple model is consistent with the results, its confidence is much higher than that of the complex model. When this gap is infinitely magnified by multiple parameters, from the perspective of Bayesian probability, the simple model is either directly rejected, but as long as it can roughly match the experimental data, it is better than the complex model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes 2 parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;occams-razor-and-bayesianism&#34;&gt;Occam&amp;rsquo;s Razor and Bayesianism
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occam&amp;rsquo;s Razor&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Bayesianism&lt;/strong&gt; are two important principles in reasoning and scientific philosophy. Occam’s Razor emphasizes &lt;strong&gt;simplicity&lt;/strong&gt;, favoring explanations that introduce the fewest unnecessary assumptions. Bayesianism, on the other hand, focuses on probabilistic reasoning, continuously updating our beliefs based on new evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;occams-razor-favoring-simpler-explanations&#34;&gt;Occam’s Razor: Favoring Simpler Explanations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occam’s Razor states that &lt;strong&gt;when multiple explanations exist, the simplest one is usually the best&lt;/strong&gt;. This idea was introduced by the 14th-century philosopher &lt;strong&gt;William of Ockham&lt;/strong&gt;, who argued that we should avoid unnecessary complexity in our reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if a strange noise is heard at night, one could assume either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was caused by the wind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was caused by ghosts moving objects around the house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occam’s Razor suggests choosing the first explanation because it relies on well-understood natural causes rather than introducing additional, unproven assumptions. While simplicity alone does not guarantee correctness, it often leads to more practical and testable theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bayesianism-updating-beliefs-based-on-evidence&#34;&gt;Bayesianism: Updating Beliefs Based on Evidence
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayesianism is a way of reasoning that helps us refine our beliefs as we gather more information. Instead of treating ideas as either absolutely true or false, it considers different possibilities and adjusts how likely each one is based on new evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if a doctor suspects a patient has a certain illness, they do not immediately confirm it. Instead, they look at symptoms, test results, and medical history, gradually becoming more confident in a diagnosis as more information is gathered.&lt;br&gt;
If new evidence contradicts the initial assumption, the doctor revises their belief and considers other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is widely used in fields such as science, machine learning, and even everyday decision-making. It allows us to make better predictions and avoid jumping to conclusions too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-relationship-between-o-and-b&#34;&gt;The Relationship Between O. and B.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More complex explanations usually have lower initial credibility.&lt;/strong&gt; When we lack strong evidence, it makes sense to assume simpler explanations are more likely, aligning with Occam’s Razor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bayesian reasoning naturally favors simpler theories unless the evidence strongly supports a more complex one.&lt;/strong&gt; If two explanations fit the data equally well, the simpler one is usually more likely to be correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>World Trends and Crisis Study</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/world-trends-and-crisis-study/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/world-trends-and-crisis-study/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been looking for the future direction recently, so I studied the development of the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1950 to 2025, a significant economic crisis or major economic adjustment occurs approximately every 10 years. During this period, the global economy has undergone an evolution from post-war reconstruction, technological innovation, market-oriented reforms to informatization and globalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-1950s-postwar-reconstruction-and-economic-prosperity&#34;&gt;1. 1950s: Postwar reconstruction and economic prosperity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the end of World War II, the world entered a period of post-war reconstruction. The economies of Western Europe and Japan recovered rapidly, and the United States became the global economic leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-1960s-technological-innovation-and-social-change&#34;&gt;2. 1960s: Technological innovation and social change
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technological advances (such as computers and aerospace) and social movements (such as the civil rights movement and the counterculture) flourished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-1970s-oil-crisis-and-economic-stagflation&#34;&gt;3. 1970s: Oil crisis and economic stagflation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) imposed an oil embargo, causing oil prices to soar and triggering global economic stagflation (high inflation and high unemployment coexisting). Two oil shocks in 1973 and 1979 led to a slowdown in global economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-1980s-market-oriented-reforms-and-globalization&#34;&gt;4. 1980s: Market-oriented reforms and globalization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many countries have implemented market-oriented reforms and liberalization policies, and the process of globalization has accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-1990s-information-technology-revolution-and-economic-prosperity&#34;&gt;5. 1990s: Information technology revolution and economic prosperity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information technology (IT) revolution has driven global economic growth, and the Internet and digital transformation have become mainstream. The Asian financial crisis in 1997 had an impact on emerging market countries, but the global economy generally maintained growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-2000s-global-financial-crisis-and-economic-adjustment&#34;&gt;6. 2000s: Global financial crisis and economic adjustment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT exploded in developing countries, and the global financial market became highly integrated. The Internet winter in 2001 and the global financial crisis in 2008 led to a global economic recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-2010s-post-crisis-era-and-the-rise-of-emerging-markets&#34;&gt;7. 2010s: Post-crisis era and the rise of emerging markets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries implemented stimulus policies, and the global economy gradually recovered. Emerging market countries such as China rose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-2020s-pandemic-and-economic-reconstruction&#34;&gt;8. 2020s: Pandemic and economic reconstruction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a global health crisis, giving rise to remote work and digital transformation. In 2020, the global economy contracted significantly due to the pandemic, and countries subsequently implemented stimulus policies to promote recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/embedded-systems-engineering/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/embedded-systems-engineering/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/embedded-systems-engineering/Embedded%20Systems%20Engineering%20Roadmap.png" alt="Featured image of post Embedded Systems Engineering" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware is hard? Then go for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2025, I did some research about future opportunities, and seems like AI can replace most single-ability people in a not far future. The block chain technology and models led by transformers are now a large market and are still expanding. Unfortunately, just like the Internet boom, the best time has passed, so I need to find something still useful in future, and I realized that the combination of hardware and software that embedded development provide is one of the strongest ability I have seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until AI can directly control the real world, micro-quantum computers appear, and brain-computer interfaces have the ability to inherit memory, embedded development will always exist - because all current electronic industry are built on the basis of embedded development. The decline of embedded means the rise of a new generation of computers with non-von Neumann architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Science alone is too boring for me. For this reason, in 2025 I decided to start learning everything about embedded development. This will be another new starting point after I acquire the ability to design for additive manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Future</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/future/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s January again! Happy new year to you all guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s electronic products are thinner and lighter than before, but they are still very heavy, especially those laptops with good performance that weigh more than one kilogram. Today’s quantum computers are larger and heavier than traditional computers—they are housed in specific rooms and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prompts us to ask: what kinds of products could define the future? Can we experience the same level of excitement as we did with groundbreaking releases like the MacBook or the iPhone X?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One promising candidate is AR glasses powered by directional beam charging technology. Currently, most AR glasses fail to replace smartphones, primarily due to their weight, with bulky batteries being the main culprit. Since this, if we can cancel the battery and use a power bank to charge, also replace the wire to wireless RF (radio frequency) technology, such as millimeter-wave directional transmission, all above problems will be solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenges are: heating problem, high energy consumption ratio chip and High-resolution transparent display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same technology has the potential to revolutionize aerospace. Traditional space elevators are constrained by material limitations. By eliminating these materials and instead using ion thrusters with vector control to maintain a fixed orbit, coupled with wireless RF technology for power transmission, we could bypass these constraints entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would pave the way for a low-Earth orbit transportation method far more efficient than traditional rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of technology is brimming with possibilities, although we feel like the technological progress has gradually slowed down or even stalled, but in fact there are still many conceptual technologies that have not been widely used.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Per Aspera Ad Astra, which refers &amp;ldquo;Through suffering to the stars&amp;rdquo;. The specific object of suffering here is still a mystery to me, but it may be a little clearer now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite Chinese translation of this sentence is &amp;ldquo;历尽艰辛，终抵群星&amp;rdquo; (After going through all the hardships, one will finally reach the stars). The brilliance of the second half is easy to understand, but the first half is too vague. What is suffering refers to? Make the right choice at the right time, sacrifice the minor to save the major in critical moment, doing things that are useful but painful, or trying to force progress when motivation is weak?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolate pain may be a great method to avoid it influence the motivation and energy, but what’s interesting is that the isolation method itself also consumes energy. Is this a loss-making exercise or a way to save the greater good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I believe that the final answer will be complex, because of this complicated world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Makes Action Hard?</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-makes-action-hard/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/what-makes-action-hard/</guid>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hard-to-start&#34;&gt;Hard to start?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find that many times I can’t start something because there is so much resistance that stops me. Since this I decided to find reasons out and trying to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m curious that where is the resistance comes from, and why it appears. Instead, I find following majority reasons, and I listed some solutions or examples I had now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fear&#34;&gt;Fear
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear is considered to be a survival instinct of human beings since ancient times. This instinct could help to protect individuals when they see the unknow beast, and they will run away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same as the modern people, when individuals meets a unknow thing, they will instinctively flee rather than fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Break down the target into small steps, see what needs to be done in each step (for example, writing an article requires different paragraphs), and make an outline to know everything you need to do. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sometimes a long outline itself can cause fear, so start by focusing on a specific section and giving it a suitable deadline is a good choice. Although deadlines are the first productivity, overly strict deadlines can cause fear and prevent from taking actions. Deadline can be brought forward after the start (e.g. to cut the time in half to improve efficiency), but it cannot be postponed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;If the above doesn&#39;t work, it means the subdivisions are not simple enough. So try to repeat the above steps for each subdivitions until they do not cause any stress or burden.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For tasks with a fixed deadline, try to at least cut the time in half to be more efficient. If the fixed deadline itself is difficult to accomplish, try to start working on it once everything are listed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;risk-cost-and-benefits-are-not-equal-or-unpredictable&#34;&gt;Risk, cost and benefits are not equal, or unpredictable
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all things have their corresponding sacrifice. Usually time, money, and energy. All things and experience are exchanging between the individual and the world, use currencies above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are forced to pay something so most of them couldn&amp;rsquo;t accept failure. If they fail, they lose all the stuff they invested. For most people, the benefits are limited, but everything they put in makes them feel physically or psychologically uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, people tend to choose stop, or even avoid to start due trying to avoid predictable risks, which is a part of the survival instinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most things, the total amount of things completed remains the same, the time is reduced, and the energy spent is increased. So there is a limit to the sum of time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this sum is limited, the different distribution of the two will greatly affect the ability to act. More energy and shorter time will cause fear, vice versa. This is because compare to the time, energy limit is more obvious and easier to feel. Less time also refers to have less time to resolve unexpected issues, which stands for bigger risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Give a looser deadline at the beginning to reduce fear, move deadline forward after start to increase efficiency.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For those things doesn&#39;t have high benefits relatively, find out its urgency and significance to replace the benefits part. If none of the above is true, avoid doing this useless thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unclear-direction&#34;&gt;Unclear direction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some individuals may have a big goal but many without details. Not enough details refers unknow, which means fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, unclear direction will stop people to trying to start because they don&amp;rsquo;t know where and how to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Break things down into enough detail and make an outline so you know what needs to be done and how to get started.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For unknown parts, search to obtain content and solutions, calculating impacts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-interesting&#34;&gt;Not interesting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain likes interesting things and dislikes boring things. When people have more interesting options, the brain will try to choose the interesting thing that is useless, rather than the useful but boring thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things are indeed useful, but the way they are done is boring, so psychological resistance will be generated to try to prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solution: Find a more interesting way to finish the thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;If the most efficient way to do the thing is not interesting, reduce relative fun. For example, reduce entertainment or ban cell phones (Reduce activities that are considered the most interesting to narrow the gap between the fun of doing serious work and entertainment. A smaller gap will produce less resistance when doing serious work).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;All above can be summed up in one sentence:&amp;quot;Make the life pure.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 Majority reasons: Fear, Risk, cost and benefits are not equal, or unpredictable, Unclear direction, Not interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solutions:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Break down the goal and form the outline.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2. Give a looser deadline at the beginning to reduce fear, move deadline forward after start to increase efficiency.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;3. Avoid doing useless thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;4. Searching for unknow parts of plan and fill out the outline.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;5. Find a more interesting way to finish the thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;6. Reduce relative fun and make the life pure.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Applying and Learning</title>

        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/applying-and-learning/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I do some review of my past life, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to find that I spend more time on learning, but not applying. Is this because I&amp;rsquo;m still a student, or I&amp;rsquo;m good at applying? It&amp;rsquo;s hard to find out the answer immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this could state for two possible reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have sort of talent on applying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am lack of applying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same time, I think the question really depends on individual&amp;rsquo;s experiences. Difficulty is a qualitative question rather than a quantitative one. Maybe I can try more practice and applying stuff such as do more projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advance forever. Happy applying!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to advance! Advance regardless any cost and consequences! No matter how difficult it is, no matter how painful the road is, we must move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as the goal is theoretically feasible, we have to push forward with all our strength and believe that it will be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/prior-probability-of-life/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of September. Looking back, this month has passed very quickly and I have learned a lot. The most important thing is to establish the White Room system, and thinking about the life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Bayesian theory, life should also consist of prior probability and posterior probability. Being alive and healthy constitutes the prior probability, while thoughts and actions constitute the posterior probability. When all conditions are met, it is the road to victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the coming month, I decided to finish my high school physics content and improve my English, everything will be checked on my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy October!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Time Slice, The beginning of everything</title>
        <link>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/time-slice-the-beginning-of-everything/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://enthalpiex.github.io/en/p/time-slice-the-beginning-of-everything/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Some thoughts on perfectionism and farsightedness&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts on perfectionism and farsightedness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in the peaceful years, no one will take risks anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that sometimes we must have a promise; so that you will not retreat, give up, or be at a loss at any time; let it be like a laser to clear the riddle and guide the direction; the past time can never be obtained, because history is pushed forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time rotates, but by the time you realize the rotation, it is too late. Fallen leaves return to their roots, but the evergreen trees in the south will not fall because of autumn. The imperfection of the world is the best gift for perfectionists; when you fall into reincarnation, it is the day when the promise is fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story, a story written from today; it will explain everything about me, where and why I do it: Make everything interesting, joyful and meaningful. Let memories become happy things, and let experience become the only evidence. When the goal is the extreme, you have to push everything higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a four-dimensional space, and I am a human living on a three-dimensional slice. Whether for civilization or individuals, only thinking from a higher dimension can solve those unimaginable or even unproposed problems - but they exist objectively, resulting in imperfection. This is time slicing. In the three-dimensional world, a cube can be easily unfolded into a flat white paper with one face, and vice versa; in the three-dimensional world, a Möbius strip can be easily created to splice two completely isolated two-dimensional worlds. In the four-dimensional world, everything in the three-dimensional world pales in comparison, so as long as the time dimension is controlled, all problems will be solved, and the originally difficult problems become easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is set to be one-way, redshift will not stop, and entropy increase will not end. Locking the flow of time greatly reduces the operating space, but it only locks the direction, so it can still be compensated to a certain extent by changing the flow rate and efficiency. This is time slicing, a new way of time management: It will truly describe this four-dimensional space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make memories an enjoyment, not a regret. Let time leave footprints, not cracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are other civilizations in the universe that are more developed than humans, I think their world must be extremely neat and tidy cities, with sharp buildings, obvious artificial features in landform transformation and various functional areas, and the operation of the city depends on powerful central supercomputer control. Aliens may look special, but they will have a lot of auxiliary equipment on their bodies, their thoughts will be more mature than humans, their logical ability will be stronger, and their emotions will fluctuate less, which is equivalent to the artificial intelligence life form in the human science fiction world. Perhaps these aliens are the silicon-based civilization heritage left behind after the disappearance of the carbon-based civilization of the planet, making these intelligent machines created to serve carbon-based creatures the new heirs of civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why alien civilizations can continue to develop must be that they are a race with less internal friction, high teamwork ability, and diverse means of observing the world. Less internal friction means that their civilization will not collapse due to resource competition, teamwork ability means high production efficiency, and diverse means of observing the world means a deeper understanding of the physical rules of the universe, so this is the reason why alien civilizations are more developed than the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien civilizations are definitely not absurd and weird cities, chaotic buildings, and backward and barbaric ideas. Such a population cannot be at the forefront of developed civilizations, but will consume each other in the competition for resources and go to destruction. Savage thoughts also mean increasing the risk of internal friction, becoming the fuse of civilization destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more advanced civilizations may be related to their special environment, with abundant sunshine, vast territory, rich mineral resources, and special metal materials, which means that their energy acquisition methods are easier and more abundant. It is possible that aliens can absorb and store energy themselves, and may convert energy in an efficient way to achieve almost no loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dare not imagine how fierce it will be in Star Wars when each civilization uses the biggest killer of their planet to launch it on the battlefield, and various aliens divide the work and cooperate in production, defense, confrontation, and plunder. They use various battleship tactics and technology to fight for space resources, and they will also form alliances with neighboring galaxy civilizations to develop resources. It is more likely to form a situation of confrontation between multiple forces, and the battlefield is full of star-shaped battleship wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is just a restatement of science fiction movies and novels, it is quite interesting :D&lt;/p&gt;
